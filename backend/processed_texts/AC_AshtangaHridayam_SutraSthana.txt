INTROOOCTION 
This treatise- .¼tanga samgraha -is an authoritative text on the science of medicine 
of ancient India. Its author Vagbhata is counted as one of the "Brhat traya" the great 
three masters (of Ayurveda) the other two being, Caraka and Susruta._ 
Nature and Contents 
As its name itself suggests, it is a Samgraha -collection / compilation of information of 
the Astanga -the eight branches of Ayurveda; in one text. The eight branches are; 
1. Kaya cikitsa (inner medicine). 2. Bala cikitsa (treatment of children/ paediatrics). 3. Graha -cikitsa (treatment of diseases caused by evil spirits (demonology). 4. Urdhvanga cikitsa 
also known as Salakya tantra (treatment of diseases of eyes, ears, nose, throat, and head). 
5. Salya cikitsa (surgery). 6. Damstra cikitsa also known as Visa cikitsa (toxicology). 7. 
Jara cikitsa also known as Rasayana cikitsa (geriatrics, rejuvination) and 8. Vrsa cikitsa 
also known as Vajikaraoa cikitsa (virilification therapy). 
Earlier to the compiling of A. Samgraha, each of these branches had its own seperate 
books, written by sages but their study was difficult. Explaining the need for his book 
Vagbhata says "each one of the texts written by them (sages) by itself does not describe 
all the diseases; to study all the texts would require a whole life time; since many things 
are common to all the texts. Hence this text has been written by collecting only the essence 
from all; it is devoid of textual blemishes, confines only to the three pillars (of medical 
science) viz. hetu (knowledge of cause of diseases -aetiology), linga (symptomatology), and 
au~dha (therapeutics); it explains many hidden, doubtful and contradictory points; is 
composed so as to be suitable to the present age, with emphasis on Kaya cikitsa (inner 
medicine) since it is difficult for understanding and pervades all other branches; there is 
not a single syllable here which is not supported by the scriptures (worksof sages), change 
in the mode of composition is done for the sake of brevity only and nothing else." 1 
A. Samgraha is a voluminous text having 150 adhyayas (chapters) divided into 
6 sthanas (sections). each containing varying number of chapters as noted below1. A. Samgraha. Su. 1/13-20.

The text is composed in both prose and verse, about 9250 together.1 Some 
chapters have prose and poetry both, while some others have any one only. The 
language and stlye of compostion are archiac and tough. Scholars also opine that 
the standard of prose and poetry varies. 
In view of it containing the essence of many ancient texts, this treatise was 
expected to earn the acceptance of the profession readily. But that did not t:tappen 
so, since we find two more identical texts (probably recensions of this text itself) 
appearing subsequently. A scrutinising study of A. Samgraha reveals many blemishes 
such as repetition of same subject both in prose and verse, e)oborate description 
of religious rites and ceremonies, unsequential placement of topics etc. have got 
into the text, contrary to the assertion of the author. This leads us to presume 
lack of adequate attention of the author at the time of compiJation. 
AuthorIn one of the concluding verses of the text, the author furnishes his own 
whereabouts as foJlows- "there was a great physician by name Vagbhata, who 
was my grandfather, and I bear his name; from him was born Sirhhagupta and 
I am from him (Sirhhagupta) born in the land of the Sifldhu. Having acquired sound 
knowledge from Avalokita, the preceptor and even more from the wisdom of my 
father and after studying a large number of texts of medical science, this treatise 
has been· written suitably classified (into branches, sections, chapters etc.)2 
This statement makes it clear that Vagbhata, son of Sirhhagupta and grandson 
of Vagbhata is the. author, that he belongs to the region of the river Sifldhu (Indus) 
and its tributories, that his· grandfather and father were great scholars of Ayurveda. 
Mention of Avalokita -the chief god of Mahayana Buddhism as his preceptor is 
suggestive of the religion he belonged to. 
Apart from these, he has not furnished any other information. Many references 
concerning him are available in the writings of later authors and all these havebeen 
studied critically. In spite of such intensive study for nearly a century by the present 
day scholars -both Indian and European -no satisfactory conclusions have been 
arrived at regarding the life and works of Vagbhata. Majority of the views are . 
'the most likely' only and liable for change. Thus Vagbhata continues to be problematic. The following are the important facets of the problem. 
1. This is the number found in the edition of Vaidya Anant Damodar Athavale et. al; pune, 
1980; the only available edition of the complete text. Prose passages long and short 
are numbered serially alqng with the verses. Since the numbering has not be.en done 
correctly the actual number may be a little more than the present. 
2. A. Samgraha. Utt. 50/203-204

1. NameWhile A. Samgraha gives his name specifically as Vagbhata, later commentators, 
Jejjata, ( 7 -8th cent) and lfldu (13-14th cent A.D.) have used the term ·'Bahata' 
in place of Vagbhata. 1 This is the Prakrit variant of the term Vagbhata and appears 
to have been popular in the society since it is seen in the commentary of Kausika 
sutra, Tibetan translation of A$taflga hrdaya, in many maouscripts of Ayurveda 
in south India and as Babhata in manuscripts of Bengal. 2 So we may agree that 
both these terms are used for indicating the same person. 
Niscalakara ( 13th cent A.D.) in his Ratnaprabha commentary calls Vagbhata 
as "Simhagupta tanaya Vagbhatagupta".3 This makes us to presume that his full 
name ·might be Vabhatagupta, similar to the name of his father Sirnhagupta. 
Jejjata calls Vagbhata as Mahajahnupati Sri Bahata. (Bahata, king of Mahaja­
hnu)4 Based on this, Niscalakara calls Vagbhata, a Rajaf$i -sage like king5 D.C. Bhatta­
charya tries to identify Mahajahnu with Majhanda, a small town about fifty miles 
north of Hyderabad in Karachi district (Pakistan)6 Hence the presumption that 
Vagbhata might have been a ruler of a small kingdom. 
2. PreceptorVagbhata names Avalokita as his preceptor. Avalokitesvara is the chief divinity 
of Mahayana sect of Buddhism, he is a Bodhisatva (future Buddha) and is being 
worshipped since the days of emperor Asoka. Idols of this god begin to appear 
from the Gupta period (300-550 AD)7. If this god is taken as the preceptor, 
then it wil1 be more a religious tradition and so only nominal. 
If there were to have been a person in flesh and blood bearing the name 
Avalokita, then there should be some evidence at ·1east. So far no such evidence 
for the existence of a scholar (Buddhist) of that name have come to light. 
' Meanwhile it is interesting to note that Niscalakara calls Vagbhata as Saunaka 
siSYa-pupil of Saunaka.8. Even Jejjata has mentioned ''Saunaka matam anuvadata 
Vagbhatena -Vagbhata approving/substantiating the opinion of Saunaka9. We do 
not know much about this Saunaka and his work. This is for investigation further.

Vagbl 1ata also states that he learnt much from his father Simhaguptci. Simhagupta 
should have been a scholar and also a reputed physician can be guessed by the 
honorific title 'Vaidyapati', king of physicians -attached to his name in colophon 
(of some manuscripts) at the end of every chapter of Astang hrdyaya 1. Soc;Jhala 
( 1 2-1 3th cnt) in his book refers to a medicinal formula compounded by Simhagupta2. 
So we may assume that the grandfather and father of Vagbhata being great 
physicians, the reputation of their family must have spread to distant places like 
Kashmir etc, so as to attract students to study under Vagbhata. • 
Son and grandson -
Cikitsakalika, a small book of 400 verses written by Tisata is available. The 
colophon at the end of this book mentions Tisata as the son of Vagbhata3. Based 
on this, some scholars consider Tisata as the son of Vagbhata But the f oJlowing 
difficulties hinder us to accept it so. In the invocatory verse the author mentions 
the names of many eminent authorities but not of Vagbhata. Has quoted from 
the works of Vagbhata but does not specify his name. 
Cafldrata, son of Tisata has written a commentary on his father's work., Even 
he has not mentioned the name of Vagbhata in it. 
Had they been the son and gradson of Vagbhata they wouid certainly have 
named such a celebrity with great pride and eulogised their family. Based on internal 
and external evidences, present day scholars have assigned Tisata and Cafldrata 
to 10th and 11th cent A.D. respectively ·(three centuries later to Vagbhata)4.-
Hence it is improbable that Tisata and Cafldrata were the son and grandson 
of Vagbhata. 
DisciplesJejjata in the colophon of his commentary on Caraka samhita styles himself 
as Bahatasi~ya -disciple of Bahata (Vagbhata)5. 
Nilamegha (9th cent AD) in his book Tafltrayukti vicara offers obeisance to 
Vagbhata and says Ifldu and Jejjata are his disciples6. This verse in course of 
time became popular and created the belief that both Jejjata and lfldu are pupils 
of Vagbhata.

P.V. Sharma doubts this very much. Regarding Jejjata his objections are (a). 
Jejjata cal1s his teacher by his name without any reverential epithets which is contrary 
to the custom prevailent then. (b) Jejjata can only be placed in 9th cent, two 
centuries later than Vagbhata. With regards to liidu his objection is again the date, 
lfldu can only beplaced in 13th cent A.D. and not earlier1. 
On this point, I wish to state that we can not disbelieve the statement made 
by Jejjata himself who was a scholar of great merit, who worte erudite commentaries 
on the works of Caraka, Susruta and also Vagbhata which are quoted by later 
commentators reverentially. Jejjata belonged to Kashmir and might have travelled 
to the neraby Sindh to study under Vagbhata. There are divergent opinions regarding 
his date ranging from 6th to 9th cent A.D. Meulenbeld opines that" Jejjata's date 
may be about 600 AD. (the age in which Vagbhata lived)2. So I t_hink we will 
not be worng in accepting Jejjata as a disciple of Vagbhata placing him as his 
junior contemporary. 
As regards liidu, his own statement that there were some commentaries on 
A. samgraha earlier to him makes it imperative to assume a long gap of time. 
At least one generation of commentators must have preceded him. lndu can not 
be earli~r than 13th cent., since he quote$ from Medinikosa of 12th cent A.D. 3 
A gap of five to six centuries betweem him and Vagbhata makes it impossible 
for us to accept his direct discipleship. 
ReligionThe religion to which Vagbhata belonged is another topic of debate since plenty 
of references are found to both Hinduism and B~ddhism in his work-the A. Samgraha. 
Taking advantage of this one set of modern Ayurveda scholars assert that he was 
a follower of Hinduism (puranic religion) while another set assert that he was a 
Buddhist. Some important points of both religions are furnished herein for the 
benefit of the interested.4 
1. Hinduism (puranic) -
Mention of gods like Brahma, Dak$a, Indra, Asvins, Rudra, Visnu, Vata, Soma, 
Surya, Durga, Katikeya, Vinayaka etc; worship of cow and brahmanas, conduct 
of yajna and offering gifts to gods, grahas, brahmaoas etc, study of the Vedas; 
Chanting of hymns, observance of Atharvanic rites, pilgrimage to holy places etc; 
legends connected with origin of diseases -eg.; Daksa-yagna. rudrakopa-Virabhadra 
janana, for origin of fever; soma (moon) first suffering from pthisis; genesis of 
sura (wine) during Samudra mathana; creation of balagrahas by Rudra to protect 
Skaiida; spiders born from the sweat of Visvamitra by his wrath against Vasistha; 
non-prohibiting of meat and wine, and many such.

Buddhism (Mahayana) -
• , Obeisance to Buddha specifically at the beginning of the text, addressings such 
as Bhaisjya~uru, Vaic;furyaprabharaja refer to Buddha only; mention of gods like 
• Avolokita, Arya Tara, Pral)asabari, Aparajita, Manibhadra yaksa etc.; prescribing 
the chanting of Dharanis (protective hymns) like Mayuri, maha mayuri and Bfja 
mantras (secret ~yl1ables) before administering medicine and also during treatments; 
mention of four Arya satya, four kinds of death, worship of Sodhi tree; remembering 
• Sasta before sleep, adopting the madhyama marga (middle path) in all activities 
etc; acceptance of the work of Vagbhata (Astafiga hrdaya especiaJly) as a sacred 
text in Buddhist countries ·Jike Tibet and China. 
From the above it becomes clear that Vagbhata has shown equal reverence 
to both religions. So we may say that Vagbhata was born in a Hindu brahmin 
family, educated in al] Hindu scriptures ·and weJI acquinted in its precepts and practices. 
He adopted Buddhism in his later life and became versed in it also. Hence the 
harmonious blend of both religions in his works. It matters l!ttle, whether he was 
a Hindu or Buddhist, the contribution of each religion for Ayurveda is glorious. 
We _!lave Ravigupta also a Buddhist. the author of Siddhasara another great treatise 
on Ayurveda. 
Works VagbhataThe main crux of the Vagbhata problem is the existence of the following six 
texts associated with him as their author. Lot of discussion has gone on to determine 
which of these are really from his pen and which are from that of others. It is 
necessary to know the salient f ea tu res of all these before forming any opinion 
on. the subject. 
1. A$taflga samgraha -
Salient features of this text have already been described in the earlier pages. 
It is beyond any doubt that it is the work of Vagbhata, son of Simhagupta . 
2. A$taflga hfdaya samhitaIt is identical in most respects with A. samgraha and even owes its origin 
to it. The author himself says "by churning the great ocean of medical science, 
a great store of nector by name Astanga samgraha was obtained, from that store 
of nector has arisen this text seperately for the benefit of the less studious. 1. By 
studying this the physician will be able to understand the samgraha and become 
a skillful and efficient physician2. 
Curiously enough, the name or any information about the author are not found 
anywhere in the body the text. But in some manuscripts, the colophon at the end 
of some sections · reads as "thus ends Nidanasthana in· Astafiga hrdaya samhita 
composed by srimad Vagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta3. Commentators

of Ayurveda texts have quoted verses of A. Samgraha as "from Vrddha Vagbhata" 
and verses of A. hrdaya as "from Vagbhata, svaJpa Vagbhata or Jaghu Vagbhata'', 
These suggest that the author of A. hrdaya is also a person by name Vagbhata. 
A. hrdaya consists of 120 chapters in total, divided into 6 sections, each with 
varying numbers of chapters as noted below1 . Siitrasthana

3. Nidanasthana

It is composed entirely in potery, the total number of verses being 7120 in 
the extant edition 1. A large m~mber of verses of A. samgraha are f ouryd incorporated 
without any change into· this text. The language and style of composition are simple 
and easy, the verses composed in different meters aimed at brevity and beauty, 
suitable to be learnt 'by heart' and kept in memory for along time. It furnishes 
an informations found in A. samgraha in abridged manner, 2 avoiding description 
of religious rites and· procedures. Methods of treatment and medicinal formula are 
in such a way as could be easily adopted by the practicing physician as a routine . 
. With these merits, this text gained greater popularity than A. Samgraha not. 
only in India but also in neighbouring countries. It has the largest number of 
commentaries in Sanskrit than any other Ayurveda text3. It has -been translated 
into Tibetan and Arabic languages Jong back. -
3. • A$taflgavataraJejjata in his commentary on Caraka samhita has mentioned a text by name 
A$tafigavata-ra4. Aru,:iadatta in his commentary quotes a verse from that and says 
that it is the work of the author of A. hrdaya5. Nothing more about this text is 
known. 
4. Madhya Vagbhata / Madhyasamhita --
NiscaJakara in his commentary on Cakradatta and· Sivadasasen in his commentary 
on A. hrdaya have quoted many verses and some prose passages from another 
text which they have calJed as Madhya Vagbhata or Madhyasamhita- middle text.

of Vagbhata 1. These verses resembles very much with those of both A. samrraha 
and A. hrdaya but do not belong to either. This makes it imperative for us to 
accept the existence of this intermediary text written by Vagbhata. 
A$tafiga Nighal)tu -
This is a smaH book of about 408 verses, being a lexicon of synonyms of 
drugs mentioned in the gaoas (drug groups) in A. Samgraha as the author says 
in the beginning of the book. But the colophon at the end of one of the manuscripts 
reads as ''thus ends A~taflga nighaotu of A. Hrdaya sarhhita written by Bahatacarya2. 
In one of the manuscripts, at its commencement there is a prayer to Lord 
Siva, in addition to the invocatory verse present in A. hrdaya. The practice of preparing 
a nighaotu (lexicon) of drugs in ancient times, is confirmed by the existence of 
such a lexicon attached to Susruta samhita3. 
P.V. Sharma the editor of the book opines that it is the work of a person 
different from the author of A. hrdaya and places him in 8th cent AD.4 
Rasaratna samuccaya 
This is a text dealing with Rasasastra ( iatrochemistry) and treatment of diseases 
using mercurial and metallic compounds along with vegetable drugs. At the 
commencement of the text it is mentioned that Vagbhata, son of Sirhhagupta is 
the author5. But it stands in no comparison in the nature of the contents, composition 
and standard either with A. Sarhgraha or A. hrdaya. Based on internal ,and external 
evidences it has been concluded that its author is a psudo -Vagbhata a person 
who has concealed his real name and passed on the book in the name of an 
earlier celebrity and this book can be assigned to 13th cent AD and not earlier6. 
So neither he nor his book is taken into consideration in the discussions concerning 
Vagbhata, author of A. Samgraha. 
Identifying Vagbhata- . 
Having had a glimpse of the nature of alJ the texts, the identification of Vagbhata 
revolves chifJy around the first two texts, viz A. sarhgraha and A. hrdaya; and 
whether both are the works of one person or of different persons of the same 
name. There are two major views on this subject.

1. Different author view -
According to this, Vagbhata son of Simhagupta and grandson of Vagbhata 
is the author of A. samgraha while the author of A. hrdaya is a different person 
having the same name. The following points are the basis for this view. 
1. Commentators such as Dalhaoa, Vijayaraksita, Srikaflthadatta, Hemadri, Sivadasa 
sena etc have quoted verses of A. Sarhgraha by the name 'as from Vrddha 
Vagbhata' and verses of A. hrdaya by the name 'as from Laghu Vagbhata tSvalpa 
Vagbhata or (simply) Vagbhat' to show distinctness of two persdns. 
2. Many dissimilarities are seen between the two texts, such as nature and style 
of composition, scientific doctrines and practices, religious and social customs 
etc. AH these go to prove different authorship only 1. 
3. Both the texts being almost of the same size, no scholar would waste his time 
and energy to write more than one book on the same subject. 
Modern votaries of this view-are P. Cordier, J. Jolly, A.F.R. Hoernle, A.B. Keith, 
M. Winternitz, G.N. Mukhyopadhaya, P.K. Gode, P.V. Sharma and others. Hoernle 
designated the author of A. Sarhgraha as Vagbhata-1 and the author of A. hrdaya 
as Vagbhata-11. 
In some recent writings Vrddha Vagbhata is usuaHy translated as Vagbhata 
the elder or senhr Vagbhata, while Laghu/svalpa Vagbhata as younger or junior 
Vagbhata. P.V. ~harma opines that, the author A. hrdaya might be a descendent 
of the same family, probably the grandson of Vagbhata son of Simhagupta, since 
the custom of naming the grandson in the name of the grandfather was in vogue 
in gupta period2. This is the reason for incorporation of verses of A. samgraha 
without any change into A. hrdaya. 
D-Common author viewThis view postulates that Vagbhata, son of Simhagupta is the author of both 
texts A. samgraha and A. hrdaya. The following points form the basis for this 
viewt. Earlier commentators like Cafldranafldana, Ifldu, Aruoadatta, Niscalakara, Bhatta 
Narahari etc have held this view. 
2. Author's own statement at the end of A. hrdaya that it is born out of A. samgraha 
and written seperately · for the benefit of the less-studious. 3 
3. Non-mention of author's name in A. hrdaya is intentional, since the author is 
sure that any body who reads it will certainly take it to be another work of the 
author of A. samgraha. Since his personal whereabouts are frunished in that, it 
is not necessary to repeat it again. 
1. P.V. Sharma- Vagbhata vivecana. p.77 to 89,293. 
2. Ibid-Ayurveda- ka-Vaijfianik ltihas. p.187. 
3. A. hrdaya. utt.40/80. 

XVII 
4. Incorporation of verses without any change from one text to another also proves 
common authorship. 
5. Simillarities between the two texts are greater than dissimilarities. Epitomisation 
of an earlier eloborate · and difficult text is apparent in A. hrdaya. 
6. There are many instances in ancient times in India that the same author writing 
more than one book on the same subject, the first one usually big and tough, 
while the subsquent ones are smaHer and easier. 
Modern votaries of this view are T. Rudraparasava, Bhagawat simhaji, Ganana-
-thsen, Haridatta sastry, N. S. Moos, Harisastry paradkar. Yadavaji trivikramji, D. 
C. Bhattacharya, Nandakishore sharma, Atrideva gupta, C. Vogel, G. J. Muelenbeld 
and others. 
Assessment of views -
When both these views are assessed on their merits and demerits the difficulties 
met with in the 'different author view' appear to be more and some even 
unexplainable. I have listed hereunder some important points along with my own 
views on them. 
1. Designating the author of A. samgraha as Vagbhata-1 is not correct. Strictly 
speaking his grandfather should be called as Vagbhata-1 whether he was an author 
or not. 
2. Interpreting the terms Vrddha and Laghu / svalpa as indicative of persons is wrong 
and translating it as elder / senior/ earlier and younger/ junior/ later is improper. 
The commentators by using these words have indicated only texts and not persons. 
Whenever more than one recension of a text is available the original large one 
is indicated by the adjective Vrddha and the subsequent small one as laghu / svalpa. 
Many instances of this pra~tice are found in all fields of literrary acivity, as . for 
example we have Vrddha Aryabh~ta and Aryabhata, Vrddha Gargya and Gargya 
samhita etc. Even in the field of_ Ayurveda we _have references to Vrddha Susruta 
besides Susruta samhita, Vrddha Atreya besides Atreya samhita; So Vrddha Vagbhata 
should be understood as indicating A. samgraha the original large text of Vagbhata 
and Laghu svalpa or (simply) Vagbhata as indicating A. hrdaya a subsequent recension 
of A.· samgraha 1. 
3. If the author of A. hrdaya is considered as the grandson of the author of the 
A, samgraha, then we nave to accept the existence of another Simhagupta (the 
second) also. So far no reference indicating such an event have come to light. 
4. No scholar capable of writing a book will copy the verses verbatim from a 
book of another author even though he might be descendent of the same family; 
l 
1. European schota,rs hold the opposite view. "It stands to reason that in ·these instances 
the attribute 'Vrddha' signifies not a senior writer or an older work as opposed to junior 
writer or younger work but rather the author of an enlarged· recension as against that 
of a shorter original or such books themselves" -C. Vogel-Introduction (p. -6) to A. hrdaya 
(Tibetan version) English translation. 

XVIII 
in such a case he would certainly announce his family • reputation at least with 
great pride. Since there is no such mention in A. hrdaya it is impossible to think 
of any person other than Vagbhata as its author. A study of the two texts indicate 
that much gap of time cannot be envisaged between them. This fact also prevents 
the assumption of a second or third generation of author for A. hrdaya. 
5. Difference on some major and minor points of scientific doctrines, practices, 
social customs etc. seen between the two texts can be understood to have occured 
not due to different authors but due to the following reasons-
(a) lack of attention -at the time of preparing A. samgraha the author devoted 
all his attention to collection of material from large number of texts and compiling 
these and so could not have paid much heed to evaluate these. Since most of 
the materials belong to other texts, these should not be taken as • the opinions 
of Vagbhata the compiler, but as of the au th ours of different texts even though 
they are not named specifically. 
(b) Changes in the social, religious, and political conditions taking place quickly 
after the disappearance of the Gupta empire had its effect on all ·literary works 
including medical science. 
6. After completing the collection of materials and compling of A: samgraha, Vagbhata 
must have noticed many inaccuracies and blemishes in it and felt the need to set 
these right. Thus were born two more recensions (revised editions) of it. These 
are, 
1. Madhya Vagbhata / Madhya samhita (middle or intermediary text) -
' Mentioned and quoted by Niscalakara and Sivadasasen. I presume its real rame 
given by the author is A.stangavatara. This seems to be the first recension. From 
quotations furnished by Niscalakara, it is found to consist of both prose and poetry. 
Though it is hazardous to express any views on a text which has not become 
available, yet we may presume that there will be differences between the original 
text and this revised text in matters such as quantum of prose and poetry, nature 
of language and style of composition etc. 
2. A. hfdaya -
Is the second recension. This has surpassed both the original and the first 
recesion in popularity because of its total avoidance of prose, containing simple 
and easy verses, compact but comprehensive description of religious rites and 
ceremonies, description of doctrines and practices, emphasis on practical points 
of therapy etc, all these testify the great attention the author has paid in preparing 
this edition. The views and opinions found in this can be relied upon as the personal 
opinions of Vagbhta 
Order of sequence of the textsThis is another subject of controversy between Indian and European scholars. 
European scholars led by Hilgenberg and Kirfel hold the view that A. hrdaya is 

XIX 
the first original text which was enlarged subsequently to form A. samgraha (hence 
known as Vrddha Vagbhata). They opine that many verses of A. hrdaya can be 
seen converted to prose in A. sa1ngraha; this process of prosification may have 
gone on for a considerable period of time, probably done by more than one person; 
an intermediary text also emerging in thi.; process. 1 
This view is not acceptable to Indian scholars who affirm that A. samgraha 
is the first. This is confirmed by the author's own statement at the end of A. 
hrdaya, that it is born out of A. samgraha. 2 The trend of thought among the scholars 
of ancient India was that the standard of scholarship is declining slowly with the 
lapse of centuries and future people will not be able to study and understand the 
difficult ancient texts. Accordingly large and difficult texts which were either in terse 
aphorisms or hard prose became converted into small comprehensive texts, 
containing simple and easily understandable poetry. A. samgraha, a difficult text 
was converted into a simple and easily understandable text A. hrdaya; an intermediary 
text Madhya Vagbhta or Astangavatara also appearing in between. 
After careful consideration of all the points described so far I also adopt the 
"common author view" -and state that Vagbhata, son of Simhagupta is t~e author 
of both A. samgraha and A. hrdaya, and even of Astaflgavatara or Madhya Vagbhata 
samhita. Further that Madhya -Vagbhata and A. hrdaya are the first and second 
recensions of A. samgraha, the original text. 
Date of VagbhataModern scholars in their attempt to determine the date of Vagbhata have gathered 
plenty of evidences both-internal and external. Taking one or more as the basis, 
a good number of dates varying widely ranging from 2nd cent B. C. to 12th cent 
A.D. have been suggested. 3 But so far no conclusions have been reached. 
Among the many evidences, the following are considered as most important. 
1. Scrutinising study of political, social, religous, literary and such other conditions 
depicted in A. samgraha suggest that the text should be assigned to post-Gupta 
(later Gupta) period of Indian history ranging between 500-650 AD.4 . 
2. Itsing, the chinese pilgrim who was in India during 675 to 686 AD states in 
his travel record that ''these eight parts (branches . of medicine) formerly existed 
i)1 eight books but lately a man epitomised them and made them into one bundle"5 
This has been accepted by most of the present day scholars as referring to Vagbhata 
and his book. So they opine that he must be placed at least a century earlier.

, 
3. There are many points of similarty between A. samgraha of Vagbhata and Brhat 
samhita of Varahamihira; both express similar views on some common topic, some 
medicinal formulae (aphrodisiac recipes) are common to both. 1 Varahamihira 
flourished during 505-587 AD. and probably was a contemporary of Vagbhata. 
4. Ravigupta author of Siddhasara is assigned a period later than Vagbhata. His 
date is now fixed as 650 AD. 2 
5. Madhavakara (8th cent AD) in his book Rugviniscaya has quoted many verses 
from A hrdaya. 
6. A medical sanskrit work called "rgud bzi" in Tibetan which resembles an A. 
hrdaya of Vagbhata closely, has been translated into Tibetan during 755-797 AD.3 
7. A hrdaya ha~ been translated into arabic under the title" "Astankar" during 
the reign of Kalalif Harun-al-Rashid. 773-808 AD.4 
8. Ali-b-sahl-Rabban- a; Tabari a persian physician in his book of "Firdaus­
al-hikma" (850 AD) names 'Astanghrdy' (a great book of) medicine of lndia)5 
This speaks about the popularity and antiquity of the book. 
_ Taking into considerabion all relieable evidences, most of the modern scholars 
of Ayurveda place Vagbhata in the 7th cent AD (about 650 AD) which I am also 
inclined to adopt. 
Commentaries of A. samgrahaAt present only one commentary on A. samgraha written by lndu is available. 
But from the statement of lndu it becomes clear that there were some commentaries 
earlier to his and those were not good.6 Unfortunately none of such commentaries 
have survived and even the names of the commentators also are not known 7. 
lndu has wr!tten commentaries on both A. samgraha and A. hrdaya in the 
common name Sasilekha ( called as lndumatI by Niscalakara) It can be presumed 
from his own statement that commentary on A. samgraha was written first and 
that on A. hrdaya next8.

lndu has not furnished any information about himself in his commentary on 
A. samgraha. In his commentary on A. hrdaya he offers obeisance to Va~is~ari 
at the commencement and to Girijesa, Vinayaka and Skanda at many places.1 
This makes us to presume that he belonged to a Hindu brahmin family devoted 
to worship of Siva and his retinue. In his commentary he has used synonyms 
of plants such terms being known only in Kashmir. So it is general1y agreed that 
he belongs to Kashmir. 
The traditional belief that Indu was a disciple of Vagbhata is not supported 
by definite evidences, has been made clear earlier. There is some difficulty regarding 
his identification . We have one more person by the same name who is the author 
of a nighaotu (lexicon of drugs etc.). Some shcolars opine that both of them are 
one and the same while some others consider them as different. There is yet another 
view that lndu, the commentator is the same as lndukara, father of Madhavakara 
(author of Madhavanidana)2. 
Lexicographer Indu, is quoted by Ks"frasvami (11th cent AD) in his commentary 
on Amarakqsa. So the date of this lexicographer should be 10th cent AD. Indukara 
father of Madhvakara should belong to 7th or 8th cent, since Madhavakara flourished 
in 8th cent AD.3 
Commentator lndu himself quotes Medinikosa, a work of 12th cent and he 
is quoted by Niscalakara (13th cent) and Hemadri (13-14 cent). So this person 
can be assigned to 1 3th cent AD or even later; . I have traced a quototation of 
Rajanighaotu in Sasilekha vyakhya. 4 which had somehow escaped the notice of 
scholars earlier. This is found in the edition of T, Rudraparasava and also of A.D. 
Athavale. If this is taken into consideration the date of lndu has to be pushed 
forward to 15th cent AD. 
' Sasilekha commentary on A. samgraha is quite eloborate and erudite. It explains 
the text and so is of great help to understand it clearly. It furnishes alternate names 
of plants (synonyms) and names popular in different provicences, especiq]ly of 
kashmir. This is of help for their recognition. 
Indu commentary on A. hrdaya also possesses the same name 'Sasilekha' and 
is available in a single manuscript. 5 Nothing much can be said about it till it is 
published.

Importance of VagbhataVagbhata shines as a bright luminary in the firmament of Ayurveda of the 
7th cent AD. Descendent of a family of reputed physicians he strived hard to preserve 
and propogate the knowledge of medicine. But foi:_ his hard work of collecting 
the essence of knoweldge of all the eight brahches of Ayurveda from a large number 
of ancient texts and preparing comprehensive books, we would have Jost much 
of the knowl~dge of many branches. 
Thus a great compiler, the first one known so far, he set the trend for preparing 
such books and he was foJJowed by many authors later. He was an embodiment 
of medical knowledge of ancient India, standing at the threshold of medieval India 
and passing on the ancient knowledge to the next generation. 
_Vagbhata is rightly counted as one of the Brhat-traya-the Great three (masters) 
of Ayurveda, namely, Caraka, Susruta and Vagbhata. Similarly under the name 
"Brhat trayI" the Great three Texts". Caraka samhita, Susruta samhita and Astamga 
hrdaya samhita are being counted. Strictly speaking Astamga samgraha should be 
counted in this list instead of Astaflgahrdaya. Astangasamgraha is great in age 
(written earlier), great in size, great in scope (subjects, details) and standard (high, 
equal to those of Caraka and Susruta). Hence its inclusion will be more justified 
than of Astanga hrdaya. 
Editions and translations of A. samgraha -• 
Its first edition was published by Ganesh Tarte of Bombay in 1888. T. 
• Rudraparasava, published the complete text together with the commentary of lflau 
from Trkhur, Kerala, during 1913 to 1924. Next, Ramacandra sastry Kinjawadekar 
of Poona published some portions of the text with lfldu's commentary. All these 
are not procurable now. In 1 980 Anant Damodar Athavale of Pune has published 
the fuIJ text together with Ifldu's commentary. This is the only one available now. 
It contains many mistakes of grammer, spelling, punctuation, order of placement, 
numbering etc, There is thus an urgent need to bring out an ideal edition. 
At present there are four translations of the text in Hindi, viz. ( 1 ) of LaJchand 
Vaidya (2) of Govardhan sharma changani (Sutrasthana ~nly) (3) of Atrideva gupta 
(sutrasthana) 1951. and (4) of Paksadhara jha ~sarirasthna) 1978. 
So far it has not been translated into any foreign language and this is its first 
English translation. 
About this translation --
This translation is based on A.D. Athavale's edition, though not good for the 
purpose. Like my earlier translations it is a faithful rendering of the text. It is not, 
a word to word translation, since I found such a one would not bring home to 
the reader the fu]] meaning and implications of the text at many places. So it 
has become necessary to add some more words for better understanding. Even 
with such addition, I assure that I have remained true to the original. 

XXIII 
Since Sutrasthana -the first section is prescribed as a text book of study for 
the graduate course, by all the Universities in India I have added explanatory notes 
at -inany places for the benefit of the students. Many of the students who went 
through the historical Introduction in my translation of Astangahrdaya; desired more 
information about Vagbhata and his works along with my views thereon. Though 
it is not possible to do justice to this difficult subject in such short introductions, 
yet I have presented here all improtant informations updated and reviewed. I feel 
my labours amply rewarded if the book helps a little at least to understand the 
greatness of Vagbhata. 
I am d~dicating_ this volume to Prof. P. V. Sharma, Varanasi, a bright luminary 
in the firmament of Ayurveda of the present day. He has greatly enriched the Ayurveda 
literature by a large number of his books and monographs, the most valuable 
among his books are those dealing with history, biographies, and edition of 
manuscripts hitherto unpublished. Each work an in-depth study of the subject, 
rep)ete with exhaustive references, thus forming an authentic document. There is 
hardly any Ayurvedist who has not derived benefit from one or the other book 
penned by him. Some years back he was being named as an authority on Dravyaguna 
Vijnana (materia medica and pharmacology) but now l!e has reached the height 
of being recognised all over the world as an authority on Ayurveda in all its aspects. 
I came in personal contact with him only in 1981 and since the first meeting 
he has been showering on me an affectionate friendship which I am. proud of 
and cherish as a rare previlage. He is constantly encouraging my literary pursuits. 
He remains to me a source of inspiration by his hard work and as a goal to be 
achieved. 
This dedication is just an expression of my indebetness and reverence to a 
great scholar. 
I convey my thanks to my daughter smt. K. S. Revathi B. A. for attending 
to the typing of manuscript with the same zeal as before. I am greatly beholden 
to the proprietor and staff of M/s .. Chaukhambha Orie!1talia, Varanasi, the reputed 
Indological Publishers, for including this book in their Ayurveda Series. 
Ere concluding I will only repeat the famous verse of Hemacandra, the Jain 
Philosopher.

Obeisances to the Buddha, who by the power of knowledge and

head is the prolonged, unrealistic and varied kinds of desires; whose 
hood the hatredness; whose poison the lust and anger; whose fangs the 
unreasonable logic; whose frightening eyes the greed; whose face is 
(the cause of) delusion and who dwells within the crevices of the body.

I bow my head in reverence to that One (rare, unjque) physician, who 
has dispelled from this world, quickly, all the rogas ( diseases) comme­

know (fully well) the science of medicine such as the Pitamaha etc. ( 1) 
Notes:- The term 'one unique physician' refers to the Lord Buddha. Kama {Just), 
krvdha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (delusion), mada {infatuation, arrogance), matsa­

are all included under the term 'Raga etc'. The mula{root, cause) for all these diseases 
is ajfiana {ignorance). The term 'Pitamaha' is usually applied to 'Brahma', generally

Persons who are desirous of a life which is the means (cause, source, 
instrument) to obtain dharma (religious merit, righteousness), artha 
(wealth) and sukha (happiness), should bestow utmost faith in the 
teachings of A.yurveda. ( 3) 
Notes:- Dharma, artha and sukha (kama and mok$a) are known as puru$arthas (aims 
of human life). To attain these a Jong and healthy life is essential. Ayurveda teaches 
how to have such a life. Hence the insistence on keeping full faith in the teaching 
of this science.

Brahma having known the immortal and eternal science of A.yurveda, 
in full, taught it to Dak&a, who transmitted it to the A~vini twins;, they 
2, 

Ayu$kamrya Adhyaya 
in turn taught it to ~a akratu (liidra). 
When diseases began to trouble the human beings, causing hinderance 
to acquisition of dharma (religious merit), artha (wealth), kama (desires) 
and mok~a (salvation) sages like Dhanvantari, Bharadvaja~ Nimi, Ka~ya­
. pa, Kasyapa, Alambayana and others went to Indra, the lord of the 
immortals, making Punarvasu (Atreya) as their leader( to learn ayurveda 
from him). 
Indra, being pleased to see the galaxy of sages, taught them 'that 
science which teaches the correct maintenance of life, which is the 
upaveda of Atharva veda, which is having eight branches such as Kaya 
(inner medicine), Bala (paediatrics), Graha (demonology), Urdhvafiga 
(treatment of diseases of the head and sensory organs), Salya (surgery 
Darhstra (toxicology). Jara (geriatrics) and V~~a (virlification therapy); 
which is sacred and which had been taught by Pi tam aha (Brahma). 
The sages having learnt the science and becoming satisfied with their 
new knowledge, exchanged views among themselves and came back 
. -happily to the world of men. To make their science-Ayurveda -long 
lasting in this world, they wrote books and also taught it to their disciples 
like Agnivesa, Harita, Bheqa, Mal}qavya, Susruta, Karala and others, 
who received it with great reverence. They in turn, wrote their own 
treatises and recited them to their teachers seated in the assembly of 
learned sages. Those treatises which were adjudged as best, attained 
fame in this world (4-13a). 
Notes : -This narration of the origin of Ayurveda varies slightly from the versions 
of other texts of Ayurveda -the Sanihitas of Caraka, Susruta and Ka.~yapa and and 
punIIJa text. the Brahmavaivarta. According to Caraka samhita, Lord Brahma, recolle­
cting the science ol life. taught it to Dak$a Prajapati {the lord of Jiving beings); Dak~a 
in turn taught it to the Asvini twins, who in their turn taught Indra, the chief of the 
Gods. When ,diseases began to trouble the human beings in this world, the sages, met 
in an. assembly at the slopes of the Himalaya mountains, desired to learn the science 
oF,4.yurvcda from Indra and bring it to the earth for the benefit of mankind. Bharadvaja, 
v.'ho H'as one among them. volunteered for this task, the assembly gladly accepted 
the proposition and deputed him to Indra. Bharadvaja approaced Iiidra in heaven, to 
Chapter 1 
teach him the science ofAyurveda. liidra being pleased, taught Bharadvaja, who after 
learning it, came back to the earth and propagated it to the sages in the assembly. 
Punarvasu Atreya, ·'one among them, propagated this science of Ayurveda ta. his 
disciples- Agnivesa, Bhe<!a, JatukanJa, Panisara, Harfta and K$arapaJJi. Each one of 
them wrote books embodying the teachings of their preceptor. Out of those, the one 
written by Agnivesa was adjudged as the best and became popular in this world. 
Susruta samhita 's version differs only after /iidra. Divodasa, the king of Kasi, who 
says that he is the incarnation of Adideva Dhanvantari and learnt this :,•cience from 
Indra directly. He taught this to Aupadhenava, VaitaraJJa, Aurabhra, Pau$kalavata, 
Karavlrya, Gopurarak$ita and Susruta, who wrote books on this science. 
Kasyapa Samhita describes that four sages-Kasyapa, Vasi$ta, Atri and Bhrgu learnt 
this science from liidra, and taught it to their sons and disciples. 
Brahmavaivarta punIJJa mentions Bhaskara, the Sun god as having learnt Ayurveda 
from Brahma directly.

Any one treatise by itself is not enough to furnish the f u.11 knowledge 
of all the diseases; an entire life will be spent to study all the texts 
because the same topics will found described repeatedly, very brief in 
some and very elaborate in others; each having its own speciality. So 
the texts, being very didactic are incredible in their purport. ( 1 3-15)

Hence, this treatise, A~tariga sangraha, has been composed with inf or­
mations collected from all the treatises and (written) devoid of irreleAyu~kamiya Adhyaya 
vant, elaborate, objectionable (statements) and repetitions; with only 
three main themes-the Hetuskafidha (on the causes of diseases; aetio­
logy), Lifiga skandha (on the signs and symptoms of diseases; symptoma­
tology) and Au~adha skandha (on the treatment of diseases; therapeu­
tics); shedding light on ( explaining clearly) many of the moot points. 
It dispels many contradictions of itself and also of the other texts and 
arranged as suitable ( to the trend of) to the present age. 
·Preference has been given to Kayacikitsa (inner medicine) especially, 
because of its constant and daily need, difficulty of understanding and 
also beacuse it pervades all the other branches ( of Ayurveda). 
There is no word (in this book) which is not found in the scriptures 
( ancient authoritative treatises); the only change, is in the arrangement 
of the text, aimed at brevity and for nothing else.( 16-20) 
Three do$as:

'3~f!Jif41t,qdql ~ ~~P-u~fq I ·~sfcl~dl~g ~ a-'4,fqAf .q-11~~11 
Vata, Pitta and Kapha are, in brief, the three Do~as of the body; each 
one is of three kinds -vrddhi (increase), k~aya (decrease ) and samya 
(normal); both vrddhi ·(increase) and k~aya (decrease) are three kinds 
utki;-~ta (severe), madhya (moderate) and alpa (mild). 
They (the do~as) destroy the body or sustain it when they are abnormal 
and normal respectively. (21-22) 
Notes:-Sam ya (normalcy) of the do$aS is to be understood in respect of their pramaJJa 
(quantity), gul)as (qualities) and karmas (functions). Bothvrddhi Uncrease) and k$aya 
(decrease) in any of these three aspects is Vikrti or vai$amya (abnormality). Do$aS 
keep the body healthy when they are normal but when they become abnormal they 
produce diseases. Diseases are severe, moderate or mild depending upon the degree 
of abnormality of the do$as. Between vrddhi (increase) a.nd k$aya (decrease) it is the 
former which produces majority of diseases. 
ij" ;;q1fq~')sfq-~qnf~~: I 
Though present all over the body, they are predominantly found in 
Chapter 1 
the regions -below, in between and above -respectively of the area 
bound by the heart and the umbilicus. (23a) 
fflsi{hi ~ ~fffi-ii ~S.=ff1i~I ~-'Ii: .i;hlih( II~~ II 
They arc predominant respectively during the last, middle and first 
periods of life, day, night and food (digestion of food).(23b). 
Notes :-Do$aS are present in every cell of the body. but in some special places 
they arc found abundantly as described above. The organs of the trunk below the 
umbilicius are the chief sites of Vata. Those in between the umbilicus and the heart 
arc the chief sites ofpitta and those above the heart are the chief sites of Kapha. Vata 
is the predominant do$a during old age. evening of the day. last part of the night and 
last stages of digestion of food; Pitta is predominant during middle age, midday, 
midnight and middle stage of digestion of food; Kap ha is predominat during childhood, 
morning. early part of the night and commencement of digestion of food. 
Three kinds of Agni (digcsti_ve activity): 
~~~qin~fl~ ~Q: «it: lllf:l 
Vi~amagni, Tik~Qagni and Mandagni are caused by their ( do~as) 
predominance respectively; while Samagni is caused by the equilibrium 
(normalcy) of all do~as. (24 a) 
Notes :-'Agni' means the digestive activity. Vi.~amagni is unsteady or erratic type of 
digestion. which is changing from one da_y to the nc,\t or from day to night; very 
unpredicatable in accordance to qualities of Vata; T11:$IJilgni is increased digestive 
activity. capable of digesting large quantities of food. very quickly and stiJJ desiring 
more. due to the nature and qualities ofpitta; Mafidagni is decreased digestive activity. 
incapable of digesting even the accutomcd quantit_y off ood within the scheduled time 
due to the nature and quantities of Kapha. All these three are considered unhealthy 
leading to the p°roduction of many diseases. Onl_v Samagni which is due to the normalcy 
of all the do$ffS is ideal for maintcinancc of health. 
Trividha ko${ha (nature of alimentary tract) : 
ffi: ~ ~~.:it- lP:-?.J: P-n{;: tt~<N 11~~11 
Ko~(ha (nature of ailmcntary tract. howel movements, nature of 
elimination of faeces) will be kn1ra (hard). m~du (soft) and madhya 
(moderate) by the pre do m in an c e of t he do~ as resp cc t iv e 1 y. \V hen a I I 
Ayu~kamiya Adhyaya 
of them (do~as) are normal, then also ko~tha will be madhya (modera­
te). (24 b) 
Notes:- Predominance or increase of vat a produces very hard faeces, with difficulty 
of elimination or even non-elimination; predominance or increase ofpitta causes watery 
or semisolid faeces, moving out more than once or twice in a day; predominance or 
increase of Kapha causes soft, solid faeces moving out smoothly. The last condition 
(madhya ko$(ha) is ideal and is also found when all the do$aS are in normal condition. 
Trividha Prakriti (three kinds of constitution):

At the same time of commencement of life, by the union of the Sukra 
and artava, the do~as which are predominant confer their own character 
(to the embryo). Just as poisonous worms develop_ from poisonous 
material, there arise (are formed) from these ( Dosha), separately, three 
kinds of praki;-itis (constitutions) -Hrna (poor), Madhya (moderate) 
and Uttama (best); Samadhatu (praki;-ti) arising from the combination 
of all three do~as in equal proportion is ideal; Dvido~aja ( praki;-tis) arising 
from the combination of any two of the do~as are bad. (25-26 a) 
, 
Notes :-Sukra is the seed from the male., artava the seed from the female; both 
of them unite to form embryo. Both of them contain the do$3S and whichever do$a 
or do$3S become predominant at the time of their union, the embryo .. that gets for_med, 
will inherit the specifi'c characteristic feature of those do$a or do$tiS. The example 
of worm/bacteria also points to this idea -· the worm developing from poisonous 
materials will inherit the same feature of poison as are found in the materials from 
which they are born. The three Prakriti (constitutions)- the poor, moderate and 
best-arise from the predominance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha do$iIS respectively; the 
constitutions arising form the combination of any two do$3S (dvandva) viz., Vata + 
Pitta; Vata + Kapha; Pitta + Kapha- are not good. Only the samadhatu Prakriti (arising 
from the combination of all the three) is ideal but it is very rare.

Combination of-any two or three of them (do~as) either in the state 
of decrease or increase is known asSarilsarga andSannipata respectively; 
such combinations are, thus six and ten kinds respectively, depending 
upon permutation of their decrease and increase. (26 b-28)

Rasa (plasma), as~k (rakta, blood), marilsa (muscle), medas (fat), asthi 
(bone), majja (bone marrow) and sukra (semen, reproductive 
elements)- these are the Dhatus (supports, basic tissues); these seven 
are also called as Dii~yas ( those which get vitiated). Likewise the miitra 
(urine), sak~t (faeces), sveda (sweat) and others which are the Malas 
(waste products) of the body. (29) 
Notes :-Dhatus a.re so named because they support the body all through the life. 
they get vhiated by the three do$aS quickly. when they will be called as d0$yaas; thus 
vitiated they become the seat of diseases. Apart from urine. faeces and sweat there 
are many other waste products also such as e>.:cretions of the nose. eyes. cars and 
tissues etc. Do$aS vitiate the malas and so even the ma las arc included under the category 
of d0$yas. ,

Ayu~kamiya Adhyaya 
Diseases are 'produced by the do~as residing in the rasa and • other 
dhatus (tissues); they ( the diseases) are said as being born from the 
dhatus, categorically, just as saying 'burns caused by ghee'. (30) 
Notes :-The do~iis are present inside the dhiitus (tissues) only. They undergo 
abnormality- vrddhi (increase) or (k~aya) decrease by the effect of different kinds of 
foods and activities. When the do~as become abnormal, they produce abnormalities 
even in the tissues supporting them. Both these abnormalities together, give rise to 
diseases, which start within the dhiitu (tissue) involved. So, diseases are generally named 
as rasaja (born from rasa), raktaja (born from rakta) and so on. The exa1J1ple of 'burns 
caused by ghee; means, hot ghee pured over the skin produces a burn (blister). We 
generally say the burns was due to ghee. But we do not usually mention the heat of 
the ghee though .it is implied therein. We are to understand by thi~ example, that the 
real cause of diseases are the do~iis present in the dhiitus (tissues), ·though while naming 
the diseases, the dhiit11,s (tissues) are described as the cause.

Prir:iana (satisfying, nourishing), jivana (supporting life), lepa (cove­
ring, adhering). sneha ( oleating, lubricating), dharar:ia (supporting). 
piirar:ia (filling the cavities) and garbhotpada (production of the embryo) 
are the functions of the dhatus (tissues) respectively. (31) 
These ( dhatus) support the body and also serve as food for the dhatus 
(for themselves) always. (32a). 
Notes :-The first dhiitu the rasa-satisfies the other tissues by supplying them 
nourishment; the second dhatu-the rakta-supports life by producing heat, making 
the heart work etc., the third dhatu, mamsa, covers the bony frame and gives contour 
to the body; the fourth, the medas provides lubrication, by its greasy nature; the fifth, 
the asthi supports the body by its hard frame, the sixth the majja, fill~ the cavity of 
the bones and the seventh dhatu, the sukra, of the male and its counter-part, iirtava 
(from the female) help the formation of the foetus. These are only the important 
functions and there are many other functions also for each dhatu. 
Just as food is essential for the growth of the body. even so, for the growth of the 
tissues food is necessary. 'The prece.ding dhiitu (tissue) produces the food for the 
succeeding dhiitu' is the doctrine suggested here. This theory will be described in detail 
in chapter 19. 
Chapter 1 
~: ~JJR: m fitqfl~A'q'-fq: 11~~11 
All things undergo Vrddhi (increase) by use of or association with 
similars and K~aya (decrease) by use of or association . with dissimi­
lars. (32 b) 
Notes:-Similarity and dissimilarity refer to the three aspects ol substances viz., 
dravya {mass, material, substance), gul}as {qualities, properties) and karmas {fu­
nctions). This is applied in this science to explain the effect of different kinds of foods 
and activities on the do$aS, dhatus etc. Foods or activities which are similar in 
{mass/material) in qualities and activities with any of the do$8S make for their increase 
in the body whereas foods or activities which are dissimilar in mass/material, qulities 
or activities, makefor decrease of the do$8S. For example eating meat increases the 
muscles ol the body by similarity of material substance, cold foods increase Kapha 
f!y similarity of quality; exercise increases Vata by similarity of actions. Dissimilarity 
should also be understood likewise. This doctrine known as 'Samanya- Vise$a Siddhanta' 
is an important one in Ayurveda, being made use of' in different contexts. 
Sa<Jrasas (six kinds of tastes):

Svadu {sweet), Amla (sour). Laval}a (salt), Tikta (bitter), D~al}a 
(pungent), Ka~aya (astringent) are the six Rasas (tastes) present in the 
substances. The ea'rlier ones give more strength to the body, than their 
successive ones. 
The first three of them mitigate V ata, the three cqmmencing with Tikta 
mitigate Kapha; K·a~aya; Tikta and Madhura mitigate Pitta; the others, 
cause their increase (aggravation) accordingly. (33b-34) 
Notes :-Svadu {sweet) taste gives more strength than amla {sour!; between amla 
{sour) and lavaIJa {salt) it is amla which gives strength better and so on. 
Madhura (sweet), amla (sour) and lavaIJ.a (salt) the first three tastes mitigate the 
(increased) vUa; while tikta (biuer), katu (pungent) and ka~~ya (astringent) tastes cause 
increase of va:ta; ka~a:ya (astringent)~ tikta (bitter) and madhura (sweet) tastes mitigate 
the (increased) Pitta while amla (sour), laval).a (salt) and katu (pungent) tastes cause 
incrense of Pitta; tikta (bitter), katu (pungent) and ka~a:ya (astringent) tastes mitigate 
the (increased) Kapha while madhura (sweet), amla (sour) and lavaQa (salt) tastes cause 
increase of Kapha. 
The properties of each taste can be described as follows : 
l. Madhura (sweet) -mitigates Vata and Pitta; increases Kapha. 
2. Amla (sour) -mitigates Vata incr~ases Pitta; and Kapha. 
3. Laval)a (salt) -mitigates vclta; increases Pitta and Kapha. 
4. Tikta (bitter) -increases v,lta; mitigates Pitta and Kapha. 
5. Ka~u (pungent) -increases v,Ita and Pitta; mitigates Kapha. 
6. Ka~aya (astringent) -increases Vata; mitigates Pitta and Kapha. 
Trividha dravya (three kinds of substances) 
m qilq;j ~ a_oq~ Rt ~ , 
I Substances (food, drugs etc.) are of three kinds; Samana (reducing 
the do~as), Kopana (increasing the do~as) and Svasthahita (suitabh! for 
maintenance of health. ( 3 5 a) 
Notes :-Substances coming under the last group-Svasthahita-do not cause ::ither 
increase or decrease of any do$a but maintain their normalcy, so the . .r promote .1ealth 
of person. Generally these are the articles off ood which are accustomed since birth 
or by Jong usage. 
Dvividha vrrya {two kinds of potencies):

Virya (potency), is usually counted as two-U~IJ.a (hot) and Sita (cold), 
· because these two qualities only are very. dominant. ( 3 5 b) 
Notes :-V1rya is defined as 'that principle . present in a substance which is the 
cause of important action. Under this definition many gu[J;Is (qualitiies) may aiso be 
included but out of all such principles heat and cold are more power[ ul. Hence. their 
importance.

one ol the three tastes -sweet. sour. or pungent. This process ol transformation is 
known as Vipaka. Substances possessing svadu (sweet} and lavaIJa (salt} tastes become 
converted to madhura (<iwcct). substanaccs oi am/a (sour) taste will get converted to 
amla (sour) itself; but substances possessing ka{u (pungent}. tikta (bitter} and ka$aya

Hrna (insufficient, decreased, poor), Mithya (perverse, opposite) and 
Ati (excessive, increased) Yogas (effects, correlation, association) of 
Kala (time, season), Artha (objects of sense organs) and Karma (ac;tivi­
ties of the body, mind and speech) are the chief causes of diseases; 
whereas their Samyag yoga (normal correlation) is the cause for 
health. (40) 
Notes:- The above statement can be described with eAamples as follows:1. Kala (season):a) Hinayoga (or Ayoga) .-heat of summer. cold of winter etc., decreasing than usual 
in a region. 
b) A1ithya_yoga -appearance of cold in summer. heat in winter etc. 
c) Atiyoga -the heat of summer. cold of "'inter etc .. increasing more than usual. 
2. Artha (senses and their objects) 
a) Hinayoga -insufhcient correlation of senses ivith their objects. For eAample, seeing 
objects in dim light. remaining in darkness; hearing very Jo w sound. not hearing any 
sound; not smelling any thing. not tasting any thing. not touching anything etc. 
b) Mithyayoga -perverse correlation of senses ivith their objects. for eAample. seeing 
objects which are unnatural, frightful. awesome ; hearing of harsh, upleasant, abusive, 
sounds; smelling unpleasant. obnoJ..:ious decomposing. putrifying types of smells; 
tasting undesirable. unpleasant. foul and dirty substances; contact of hard weapons, 
Chapter 1 
dirty things, harmful insects etc. 
c) Atiyoga -excess correlation of senses with their objects as for r:xample, seeing 
very bright objects for Jong time; hearing very loud sounds; smelling very powerful 
substances like pepper, chillies,· musk etc., eating of large quantities of substances 
of all tastes often; too much of heat, cold, massaging etc. 
3. Karma {functions of the, body, mind and voice). 
a) Hfnayoga -not doing any activity or doing very little of it, physically, mentally 
or vocally. 
b) Mithyayoga -unusual or unaccustomed activities like falling from great height, 
jumping, riding, massaging, scratching, twisting of body parts, suppression or initiation 
of natural urges of urine, faeces etc, and other kinds fo tormenting the body. 
c) Atiyoga -indulging in activities more than usual through the body, mind or speech. 
Excessive eJ.ercise, sexual intercourse, riding, too much of talking 1~n high pitch for

Roga (disease): 
~ ~q~,o4 <ilq~uw1i<l•1t11 1 ~um"~~ i@T: ll'd~II rn ctl'-llt 911 ~ aJ a: RI g,.., Ii fq fllqr , 
Roga (disease) is the abnormalcy of the do~as whereas their 
normalcy is health. Diseases are of two kinds -Nija {organic, endoge­
nous, internal) and Agan tu ( external, exogenous); likewise even their 
Adhi~thana (abode, dwelling, seat) is also two -Kaya (body) and Manas 
(mind).(39) 
Notes :-Mere abnormality of do$aS is not disease but disease is the product or 
effect of abnormality of do$aS. So also is the case with health; normalcy ol do$aS 
help in the maintenance of health. 
ManodO$BS (do$.iS of the mind): 
((iH~Jt~ li'1ftl ~ ~ ~q•:!~•~ffi ll'd~II 
Rajas and Tamas are considered as the two do~as of the manas 
(mind) (40). 
Notes :-According to the Upani$ads everything in this universe is said to consist 
Ayu~kamiya Adhyaya 
of the three MahAguJJAs -the Satva, Rajas and Tamas. Satva represents intelligence, 
joy, enthusiasm, purity and so is good and benevolent; Rajas represents activity, 
emotions, force, energy, quickness, and instability; Tamas stands for inactivity, 
ignorance, mass, Jazyness and stability_. These properties are present in all the things 
of the world in varying proportions. 
As applied to the functions of the mind, Satva guJJa, when predominant gives rise 
to great intelligence, joy, enthusiasm, purity of thought and actions. Persons endowed 
with such qualities will be good in all respects. They are moral, polite, active, intelligent, 
joyous and always think good and do good to all. Hence, satvagul}a and persons having 
satva guIJa more, are the ideal and considered as healthy. 
Rajas, when predominant gives rise to over-activity, instability, haste, emotions like 
anger, bra very, passion and attachment; persons of Rajo gul}a will be very emotional 
highly irritable get into fits of anger and violence most of the time; they are dreaded 
and hated by others. 
Tamas, when predominant gives rise to ignorance, Jack of enthusiasm, griet: timidity, 
lazyness and inactivity. Persons of TamoguIJa, will be slow in all activities, foolish, 
dull, timid, grief stricken, worried and sleepy. 
Satvagul}a being good, is conducive to health. Both Rajas and Tamas are bad, not 
conducive to health and so considered as do$AS or blemishes.

The patient is to be examined by Darsana (inspection, seeing), 
Sparsana (palpation, touching) and Prasna (interrogation, questioning) 
etc; the disease is to be examined by its Nidana (aetiology, causes), 
Pragriipa ( prodromal symptoms), Lak~aQa ( specific signs and 
symptoms), Upasaya (therapeutic tests) and Apti or Saqiprapti (pathoge­
nesis) ( 43) 
Notes :-Inspection, palpation and intertogation are three important methods of 
examination; there are some other methods also such as olt~ction (smelling) and 
gustation (tasting) which are employed rarely. Likewise examination of the patient 
is to be done by restoring to pratyak$11 (perception), Anumana (inference) and Apta

Here (in this science) Desa (place, seat, territory, region) is of two 
kinds -Bhiimi (land, geographical region) and Deha (the human body). 
Jan.gala is that region in which breeze (and vatado~a) are prominent; 
Anupa is the region in which water (and Kapha) are dominant; and 
Sadhara1.1a is the region in which all the malas (do~as) are in their normal 
proportion. (45 b). 
Notes:-The names Jangala. Anupa and SadhararJ-a are applicable both to the regions 
of land and also of the body.

Kala time is used to denote K~a]).a and others (moment), second,

of diseases; and both these are related to the action of drugs. ( 45 b ).

In brief, Au~adha (treatment, therapy) is of two kinds, Sodhana 
(purificatory) and Samana (palliative). 
Notes :-In fact, there are many other kinds of treatment such as brmharJ-a ( stoutening), 
langhana (thinning), snehana (lubricating) ruk~arJ-a (dessicating), svedana (sudation). 
But all of them can be included under either sodhana or Samana. So they have not 
been mentioned here separately. 
For the do~as of the body. Basti (enema), Vireka (purgation) and 
Yamana (emesis) are the best therapies respectively; so also taila (oil), 
ghrta (butterfat, ghee) and madhu (honey) the best medicines (respecti­
vely). 
Ayu~kamiya Adhyaya 
Dhi (discrimination), Dhairya (courage) and Atmadi vijfiana (spiritual 
teachings) are the best medicines for the disorders of mind, (46,.47). 
Notes:-Administrationofenemasanduseofoilareindicatedfortreatmentofincreased 
V4ta; Purgations and use of ghee for the treatment of incresased Pitta; emesis and 
use of honey for the treatment of increased Kapha. In the treatment of mental disorders, 
infusing courage, counselling, assurance of success in treatment etc., are more impo­
rtant than medicines.

A student who is devoted to (serve) the teacher, who has a keen desire 
to study, endowed with great intelligence, memory and talent; whose 
face, mouth, nose and eyes are normal and pleasant to look at, who 
is a BrahmacarI (celibate), who can withstand the duels, who is coura­
geous, virtuous and steadfast, who has exhibited these qualities to the 
teacher for over six months, who is pure (in talk), humble (or shy) in 
behaviour, clean and endowed with many other good qualities should 
be initiated (for study) and taught till he attains mastery in the science 
and professional activities ( 2-3 1 / 2) 
Notes :-In ancient times in India, the students were being accepted by the teacher 
only after strict scrutiny of their physical and mental qualities and behaviour. A simple 
ceremony was being held in which both the teacher and the taught took oaths, the 
teacher to teach the science ungrudgingly and the student to be obedient, faithful and 
attached to the teacher and learn the science. 
Brahmacharr is an young boy who adheres to the rules of normal disciplines like 
celebecy, religious ferver etc., which are congenial for acquisition of knowledge. The 
term 'Jitadvaiidva' means he who has conqured some duels such as heat and cold, 
likes and dislikes, happiness and misery etc., in other words, capable of enduring

The study should not be undertaken at inauspicious times, at times 
of thunderbolt (rain and storm), earthquakes and eclipses, on days of 
full moon and new moon, during the absence of the (planet) Guru 
(jupitor). The study should be done without splitting the words too much, 
not very slow, neither in a very high pitch nor in very low pitch. ( 4-5) 
Notes : Selection of proper time for study was to prevent its discontinuance in the 
middle by natural calamities and to ensure keen attention . The method of instructions 
being oral by repetition of verses, care was taken to preserve the words, syllables 
and sentences intact, to have clear pronunciation and also to avoid exertion to the 
body.

The student should wear clothes / dress inferior (less) to that of his 
teacher; dress himself diff erntly ( than the teacher); he should serve 
the teacher like ( serving) a king, should go to sleep only after the teacher 
has slept and get up early before he gets up; should not utter only the 
name of the teacher (without adding respectful words); should not 
imitate, making fun of any inadvertent word or act of the teacher. ( 6-7a) 
Notes :-These are the rules of conduct for the students and they are clear indications 
of the importance attached to development of moral character and cultured behaviour. 
Serving the teacher like serving a king means serving him with both fear and respect.

knows the appropriate time (for every activity); who has mastered the 
science (of Ayurveda), is conversant with Arthsastra (etymology); who 
looks after the destitutes and the sick as his own children and who has 
obtained permission from his teacher (to practise medicine) deserves 
to be called a "Physician".(7-9a)

The good or bad of the weapon, science and water depend upon the 
holder (user, receiver, vessel respectively). Hence one should enhance 
his knowledge by the study of many sciences. ( 12) 
Notes :-A sharp instrument in the-hands of a cruel person will be used by him to 
injure others while the same in the hands ofa wise man will be used for useful purposes; 
so also the science, a wicked scientist uses his knowledge to harm others, whereas 
a wise one uses it for providing happiness to others. Hence every person should gain 
more kno wlcdge by studying many sciences and thus gain wisdom to use his science

The person who, inspite of being a patient, has a desire to live should 
avoid the physician who is devoid of the qulatities mentioned earlier 
and, who sells his treatments (for earning money), for such physicians 
are the leaders (who march in front) of death.(20) 
Notes :-In the above verses are described what is called 'the professional ethics', 
the do 's and dont 's for the physician. By following these rules the physician not only 
earns a good name for himself but also for his science. Medicine being a noble 
profession, requires its followers also to be noble and respected. He should select 
suitable patients and his treatment should be efficacious. Treating such patients who 
do not deserve, brings only bad name. The physician should not be very much alter 
earning money alone but be compassionate towards his brothers, especially the sick.

The physician should be efficient, posses perfect knowledge, be 
dextrous in action and clean. 
The drug should be, fit to be used in many forms, posses many good 
proprcties, potent and suitable. 
The attendant should be aff cctionatc (with the patientJ, clean efficient 
and intelligent. 
The patient should be wealthy, obedient to the physician, possess good 
memory and strong will.(21-22)

Out of these four, if the physician is inefficient the remaining three 
will be useless even though they are good; but if the physician is efficient 
he can manage the treatment even though the others limbs are inefficient. 
Hence it is the physician who is the most important for medical treatment.

Dvidha Vyadhi (two kinds of diseases)

Diseases are of two kinds -Sadhya (curable) and Asadhya (incurable); 
each one is again of two kinds; Susadhaya (easily curable); Ki;-cchrasa­
-dhya (curable with difficulty); Yapya (controllable) and Anupakrama 
(Unmanageable). ( 2 5)

Disease is easily curable and in short time if the body of the patient 
is capable of withstanding all types of therapies ( treatmen_t), if the 
patient is a youth, a male, has control over his sense organs; that disease 
which has few causes, mild prodromal symptoms and mild characteristic 
features; has no complications, in which the Do~as, Du~yas, (tissues) 
Desa (regions) Kala (season) and Praki;ti (constitution of the body) are 
all dissimilar; when all the limbs of treatment are good, during auspicious 
(beneficial) planetary constellations; the disease arising from only one 
Do~a, manifesting in one pathway only and which is of recent onset. 
(25-26) 
Notes :-The condition in which the do$8S and dhatus are of the same nature, 
is said to be tulya {similar) and when their nature are (different), they are said to 
, 
Sai$opanayaniya adhyaya 
be atulya {dissimilar). combination of two of similar qualities will produce a powerful 
diesease whereas combination of two, of different qualities produces a mild disease. 
Hence, similarity in respect of do$3S and d0$yas make the disease incurable while their 
dissimilarity makes the disease curable. For example, a disease caused by the increase 
of Kapha involving medas dhatu (fat) which is also of similar nature of Kapha, will 
be incurable but if it involves asthi dhatu (bone) which is of different nature it will 
be easily curable. Lilewise a Kapha disease arising during var$a ftu {rainy season) in 
a person of Vata Prakriti {constitution) and in jarigala desa {desert-like, or arid region) 
all being of different nature are easily curable etc. Disease may be caused by one 
or more do$3S, that which is caused by any one do$3 will be mild and so curable but 
the disease caused by two or all the three do$3S toge:her, will be severe.and so incurable. 
Diseases manifest in three different pathways -the internal, .middle and external -in 
the body, if they involve any one of them it is easily curable but involvement of more 
than one will be either difficult or incurable. 
Susadhya (easily curable) means that which can be cured with simple 
methods and within a short time.(28 1 /2) 
f~~QI~: f~~ lit~~ Pf'(o1 ~ I ~qf ~l~JR_fli\R": 11':tQ.II 
Krcharasadhya (curable with difficulty) means that which requires 
more than one difficult method of treatment, takes long time, has many 
incurable (distressing) symptoms, which might need surgical and other 
methods of treament. (29)

Yapya is that disease which though generally opposite (in qualities) 
of the curable, still persist for the remaining period of life, giving slight 
relief by suitable pathya ( diet and medicines), getting aggravated again 
by even trivial causes, does not get cured without leaving remnants, 
arising from the bad actions ( of the patient), cotinuing long because 
the person has a certain definite span ( duration) of life (hence unable 
to kill him), the person (patient) subsisting by the strength of suitable 
foods and drugs, just as a crumbling edifice by the (support of) pi­
llars.( 30-31)

Asadhya -is that, other than the above, in which all treatments fail 
and so has to be rejected; because it possesses qualities entirely opposite 
of the curable and also because it produces giddiness, delusion, restles­

The healthy person, in ordeT to protect his life, should get up from 
his sleep in the Brahma muhurta, after considering the condition of 
digestion of food (of the previous night) whether properly done or 
not. (2) 
Notes :-liidu, the commentator says that the last yama {the last three hours) of 
the night is known as Brahma muhurta because it ts the best time for obtaining Brahma 
or knowledge. Any time from 3.00 A.M. to 6.00 A.M. is the ideal time to get up from 
bed and begin the day. If one fi"nds that the food taken in the previous night has not 
I been fully digested he may sleep for some time more but not beyond sunrise on any 
day.

After getting the urge of urine and faeces naturally (of their own

facing south; silently, sitting,, .covering the head with cloth, attending 
to the urge commenced on its own and without initiating the urge by 
force; avoiding places which are very d-irty, centre of the road, heaps 
of mud or ash, a cowshed, place of assembly, cowdung heap (or pit), 
Chapter3 
ramparts of the city, place set for fire altar, ant-hill, garden, ploughed 
land, burial ground or funeral place; in front of or on the trees; facing 
or in front of women, sacred thing, cow, sun, moon, wind, food, fire

wish. 
With urge of elimination being patent, one should not attend to any 
other work, just as no other therapy is urtdertaken without getting 
rid of the curable diseases. ( 3-6) 
Notes :-The point to note here is neither to initiate the urges voluntarily nor 
to suppress it when manifest. Both these are the causes for many diseases.

Those desirous of good taste, cleanliness and good smell of the mouth 
may keep in the mouth tender leaves of tambula along with jatrphala, 
lavanga, karpura, karikola and katuka along with pugaphala. This (tambuDinacarya adhyaya

It is harmful to those suffering from bleeding disorders, injury to the 
chest, emaciation, eye diseases caused by increase of dryness; poisons, 
fainting, intoxication and tuberculosis. It is beneficial, after getting up 
from sleep, after meals, bath and vomitting. 
Two betel leaves, one arecanut, with little quantities of lime (slaked 
lime) and (extract of) khadira will be ideal (combination).(35-38a) 
Notes :-Tambula sevana or pan chewing is ancient custom in our country. It has 
its importance even as gesture ol showing respect to elders and gods. Ayurvedic texts 
describe many ol its useful properties. Though use of tobacco along with betel lea veE 
is not mentioned any where in ancient books, it has become a practice now-a-days, 
with many people to add tobacco also. But tobacco being a poisonous substance should 
be avoided totally. It has now been established that tobacco produces cancer of the 
mouth, throat and lungs.

Notes:- The profession chosen must be a noble one, respected, beneficial to himself 
and to others alike; professions which are of temporary gain, harmful, undignified 
should not be followed. 'Two worlds' means the present world {life) and the next world 
(life). Practice of a profession of righteousness (Dh8rmika V(tti) bestows happiness

tiredness, debility and old age just as the axle of the chariot and the

leather bottle become durable by oiling them ( so also the body). 
V ata is mainly responsible for tactile sensation and the tactile sensa­
tion is through the skin. Oil-bath is best for the skin and so it should 
be done daily. 
Oil should be applied especially to the head, ears and feet; on the 
head it is good for the hairs, skull and the sensory organs; inside the 
ears it relieves the pain (diseases) of the lower jaw, neck, head and 
ears; applied to the feet (soles) it makes them strong1 promotes sleep 
and vision; cures loss of sensation, tiredness, · stiffness, contractures 
and cracking of the feet. 
Oil-bath should be avoided by those suffering from diseases of Kapha 
origin, who are undergoingpurificatory therapies (like emesis, purgation 
etc.) and those having indigestion~(54-60)

Man should take food observing the prescribed regimen, without any 
hurry; after offering prayers to the food, offering it (food) with pleasant 
mind to the god of fire and to the poor and and destitute as charity 
along with drinking water, asking them to eat happly sitting in a secluded 
place. 
One should NOT eat the food cooked solely for himself, food which 
is offered by or on behalf of a person who is going to die shortly, or 
on behalf of a deadman; offere·d by persons living in (poverty or) misery; 
offered by women, slaves, the impotent, the sinner, the cruel and the 
wicked; food served in big assemblies, by enemies; and prostitutes; food 
served in sacrifices, by badmen, and that sold in shops; 
Food should not be eaten keeping it above (keeping it on a table, etc), 
water should not be d"runk from the palms of the hands; all types of 
food prepared from tila (sesamum) should not be eaten after sun-set. 
After taking food, person should neither exert him-self nor indulge 
in forbidden comforts (by scriptures). (75-79) 
Notes :-Ch:ritable offering of food to the poor. asking them to eat happily was 
an essential daily ritual. During such an offering a Vedic h_,i-mn was being chanted_. 
invoking them to be happy with the gift. Scriptures prescribe that food should be-not 
be prepared for one's own sake but it should be for the sake of others also. He who 
Dinacarya adhyaya 
eats alone without sharing it with others is a sinner. Similarly p11r_taking of food offered 
just before or after the death of a person by his relatives was also considered 
inauspicious and sinful. The term 'utsaiiga' means any height above the level of the 
waist; keeping food on a table or holding in the hand above the level of the waist 
for purpose of eating is described here as bad.

Afternoons should be spent in the company of persons, who are liked, 
who are good and helpful; engaging oneself in reading stories dealing 
with the three qualities with Dharma (rightousness) predominating.( 80) 
Notes :-The three qualities are the dharma (righteousness) artha (wealth) and 
kama (desires, passion, Just). "The stories should be such-as having more of dharma, 
moderate artha and least olkama" says Indu, the Commentator .

One should not associate with persons who are hated by the society 
and the king (government) and those who are atheists.( 81 a) 
Notes :-Society hates people who are mischievious, cruel, voilent, wicked and 
immoral; theives, robbers, murderers, traitors, spies and enemies are those hated by 
the king (government); atheists are those who have no faith in god, sacred scriptures 
or religion.

Person should not harbor quarrelsomeness and cruelty in mind, but 
be courageous both during happiness and misery.(81 b) 
One should be contented with all things other than the scriptures, but 
not be contented with the scriptures (in other words, be ever interested). 
Notes :-Man is interested in many things such as food, drink, sports, sleep, sex, 
dress, perfumes, ornaments, company of friends, good knowledge and ever so many. 
All that he likes, wants or aspires for will not be available to him at all times to his 
• heart's content. At such times he is sure to get disappointed, depressed and worried. 
These, existing for some time will spoil the health of the person. Hence, it is very 
Chapter 3 
necessary for everyone to be "contented with what he has now" rather on desire for 
"more of what he has or for others which he has not got". Scriptures describe the 
good and bad~ the effects of proper and improper use, remedies and methods to 
overcome the bad effects ·and many such instructions. Hence the advise here, that one 
should be ever interested.and inquisitive to learn more from the scriptures.

Notes :-Persons of the above categories will be always committing bad dee_d. 
They should be told that by doing so they will be earning sin and so go to hell after 
death, to suffer the torture of fire etc. They should be convinced to abstain from doing 
such sinful activities and reformed into good men.

One should adopt what is the best (essence) for the life from this 
worthless (unprofitable) life, keeping in mind the fear of death every 
minute, which has its own ways in accordance with the good or the bad 
deeds of persons. 
The life of a person which is endowed with health, wealth, learning 
and practice of dharma-kriyas (acts of benovalence) for long years is 
known as Sukha Ayu (happy life) which is also Hita (suitable) one; while 
a life with opposite qualities is its opposite.( 122-123) 
Notes :-Sukha means happiness and Hita means suitable. proli'table or useful. 
A life in which health. ivealth learning and practice of benevolent activities is possible 
is .known as Sukhayu and Hitayu and it is· to be desired and achieved by cverJ' one. 
That lite which is full of ill-health. poverty. ignorance and malcrnlent activities is • 
known as Dukhayu (life of misery) and Ahitayu {unsuitable or useless life). which 
is to be desisted.

In the society, the King is the repository of all power; hence every 
one should act in such a way as not to insult him but serve him with 
devotion; so in his presence one should avoid showing one's back and 
knees (legs) without covering them with cloth; sitting in indecent 
postures, indulge in anger, laughter, dispute (quarrel), spit, yawn and 
do such other acts even though they are natural. ( 124-125)

The manifestations of the qualities of Satva etc. (satva, rajas and 
tamas) are many and varied (in life); each one should be considered 
on its merits or demerits and only those found suitable for one's own 
life should be adopted. Any other good rule or regimen found elsewhere 
(apart from these described here so far) should also be adopted. ( 126) 
Notes :-The three Mahagw_uis _, the Satva, Rajas and Tamas make up of all the 
activities of all living beings. Satwa is considered as pure and beneficial to all. A life 
dominated by Satvaguna is the best, possessing all good features such as profound 
knowledge, intelligence descrimination, joy enthusiasm etc. It is to be desired and 
all attempts should be made to achieve it. But these-satwa, rajas and tamas are always 
found mixed together, with one or two of them predominant throughout life. Rajas 
is the quality whch is the cause for emotions like pleasure, attachment., desire, anger, 
hate and even cruelty. Tamas is the quality responsible for ignorance, foolishness, 
timidity and inactivity. Rajas and Tamas are considered as bad and even harmful. 
Upani$ads {philosophical literature) and Dharmasastras {codes ofethics) have, in great 
detail, described the means and methods to increase Satva gw;uis by adopting different 
kinds of foods and activities during the period of life. The rules and regimen described 
so far are a few from those found in scriptures. Adopting these and many other such 
activities, Rajas and TamoguIJas will be reduced and the SatvaguIJa dominates making 
one's life happy, wholesome benovalent.

A person adopting the best way of life embodying all the good 
characters will be praised by every body, as a ocean of best qualities, 
protected by gods and lives for a hundred years and more, doing acts 
of benovalence all through and following the path of Suga ti, attains Tu&ti 
(permanant happiness, or mok&a) after death.( 127) 
Notes :-The code of right conduct {Sad vrtta and Sadacara) described in this 
chapter to be followed by every person is formulated not only for maintainance of 
health of individuals but also of the community. In ancient times, a river or Jake which 
was the soprce of water for one or more villages could be polluted by wrong use and 
could cause many epidemic diseases. Likewise, the social behaviour of individuals 
would lead to disharmony and cruelty between communities and states. Taking all these 
factors into consideration, the learned sages regulated the behaviour of individuals 
thereby ensuring community health also. , 
All the do 's and dont's prescribed herein were very relevant in ancient times. But 
as time passed on a Jot of changes has taken place inevitably, in the mode of life, 
social and religious customs and manners. Hence, some of them have continued to 
be observed strictly, some others have disappeared; while some are irrelevant to the 
present day, some cannot be put to practice at all. Hence, it is quite likely that present 
day students may show scant respect for these ancient code of ethics. But with a little 
discriminatory thought, every one can understand the principles of health behind these 
regimen and adopt it with slight modifications, suitable to the living conditions of the 
present day. 
1 The term "sugati nimna" is signili"cant as it can be interpreted in two ways -firstly 
to mean "path for the ideal goal" in the ordinary sense and as secondly to mean the 
'Path of the Suga ta' in a special sense to mean the Buddhism.

Kala (time) is divinity, it has neither a begining nor an end, it follows 
the accumulated effect of actions ( of the past), Ordained by it, the 
Adityas, Kha (akasa) and other mahabhuta undergo transformation, it 
is the cause for the birth and death of all living beings, for the disorders 
and excellence of the seasons; of the tastes and potency ( of all the 
substances); of disorder or excelence of the strength of the do~as and 
the body.(2) 
Notes :-Adityas arc the shining objects in the sky and.includes the sun and other 
planets. the stars etc. The five mahabhOtas arc_. the P.rthvi, Ap, Tejas, Vata and Akasa, 
from the combination of which all the thingsJn the universe are created, Everything 
in this universe is constantly undergoing change. The change from an earlier condition 
to its succeding condition is ivhat is called "Kala" (time) or in other words "PariJJama '' 
(change). Because of the cilange, only ive recognise myriads of substances in the world. 
Everything in the cosmos starting from the planets down to the minutest substance, 
undergoing change or transformations. follows some orderliness which can be recogni-: 
sed. The changes in the atmosphere into what is called the 'seasons' follow a dcfencte 
order. So also the physical body of all living beings. These changes are inexorable 
(unavoidable. uncontrollable) goes on silently without break. Bcacuse of these changes 
only the body goes in [or diltcrcnt conditions (age); the properties of substances such 
as 1-aste. potency etc .. arc determined and the good or bad of all things are formed.

It is divided into the following twelve parts :-Matra, Ka~tha, Kala, 
N aC,ika, Muhiirta, Yam a, Ahoratra, Pak~a, Mas a, Rtu, • Ayana and Va­
r~a. ( 3) 
The period of time required for winking the eyelid once is a Matra; 
fifteen of them make one Ka~tha; thirty of them is Kala, they with 
addition of ten and twenty (30+ 10+20) make one Na4ika, two nadikas 
make one Mahiirta, they are four in each equal parts, in day and night; 
Four muhiirtas, minus one-fourth of it is a Yama. Four yama make one 
. Ahas (day) and four make one Ratra (night); fifteen such day and nights 
together make one Pak~.a (fortnight), . two pak~as make one Mas a 
(month); culminating with the end of the white half; Masas (months) 
starting with Margasir~a, in combination of two succeeding ones consti-, 
tute the six Rtus such as Heman.ta, Sisira, Vasanta, Grr~ma. Var~a and 
I I Sarad respectively; the three of them comrnencing with Sisira are 
charectorised by the udagayana (northerly movement) of the sun and 
is also called Adana; the remaining three is Dak~il)ayana (southern 
movement of the sun) and is Visarga; both Adana and Visarga together 
is one Var~a (year)(4).

Of these two ( ayanas), the Adana (Uttarayal)a -northern solastice) 
is Agneya (hot, having predominance of heat). The sun will be having 
very hot rays, its burning disc surrounded by circular ring and emits 
great heat. By contact with hot rays of the sun, the air also becomes 
hot and dry; both together, dry up all the moisture of tl)e earth, take 
away all the cooling qualities (portions); the dryness caused thereby, 
makes the bitter, astringent and pungent tastes more active and brings 
about debility in human beings. ( 5)

Visarga ( dak~inayal)a) is saumya (mild, cool). In this period, the sky 
will be having abundance of clouds, breeze and rain; the sun moves 
in the southward direction, the moon is powerful, producing cold, the 
atmosphere is pleasant, helped by th~ cool rain which makes the sour, 
salt and sweet tastes more active in successive order and brings about 
increase of strength in humans. ( 6)

The strength of the people will· be at its best in hemafita and sisira 
(i;tus); it will moderate in sarad and vasanta (i;tus) and poor in var~a 
and nidagha (1;-tus) of Visarga and Adana respectively.(7) • 
Notes :-The movement of the sun will be little more towards the north on its 
eliptical path and so the earth comes a little nearer to it. This is known as UttarayaIJa 
(northern solatice). The sun's heat becomes more, takes away the moisture of the earth 
and makes all men weak. Hence called as Adanakala. During the next six months the 
mo vcmcnt of the sun will be slightly towards south on its eliptical path, t-11e earth moves 
Chapter 4 
a little a way from the sun. This is known as Dak$iIJaayaIJa ( southern solastice), the 
sun's heat reduces, the moisture on the earth increases and this makes men stronger .. 
Hence caJJed as Visargakala. This cycle is repeated alternately in a defenite time and 
pattern. 
The nature of the two semesters described above are quite opposire of one another. 
The UttarayaJJa or northern solatice being ho£, reservoirs of water dry up, the air is 
hot, the moisture of the plants and of all Jiving beings becomes greatly reduced by 
evoporation, because of this, the body becomes weak, requires plenty of water to 
replenish the1ost quantity; the plants loosing their moisture become saples,5 and the 
bitter, astringent and pungent tastes which originate with dominance of Tejas (lire 
like property) become more powerful. Hence such of the plants which have these 
properties by their nature will be found very powerful during this period. So people 
are advised to avoid the use of such substances possessing these tastes for their food 
and drink. This is the best season to collect medicinal plants containing bitter, astringent 
anil pungent tastes. 
The Dak$iIJayaIJa or southern solastice is colder. There will be rain aplenty, all the 
reservoirs of water are full and overflowing , the water content in plants and animals, 
increase considerably and makes them strong. The plants yeild good amount oljuice. 
the sour, salt and sweet tastes which originate from predominance of AP bhuta (water 
elements) and such plants which have these tastes naturally are found in plenty. So 
people are advised to avoid the use of such substances for their food and drink. This 
is the best season to collect medicinal plants containing sour. salt and sweet tastes. 
As stated earlier, two consequetive months starting with Margasiras constitute the 
six 8tus as follows:1. Margasira + Pu$ya = Hemaiita (Winter) = 
2. Magha + PhiilguIJa = Sisira ( cold, dewy) = 
3. Caitra + Vaisakha = Vasafita (Spring) = 
4. Jye$fa + A$a</ha = Gri$ma (summer)= 
5.SravaIJa+Bhadrapada= farsa (rainy)= 
6. A.rfvayuja + Kartika = Saraf (autumn} =

During Hemanta rtu (winter season), all the quarters (area all around) 
appears smoky with covering of thick mist, sun also is covered likewise, 
cold breeze from the north causes horripilations; trees like lodhra, 
priyafigu, punfiaga, lavali are full with blossom; animals such as the 
elephant, goat, buffalo, horse, crow and pigs are more ferocious; the 
reservoirs of water are covered with a layor of mist, with very little 
of fishes and birds; rivers covered with mist, the water of wells and 
ponds are warm. The temperature of the body (of men and animals) 
beaten by the cold wind goes deep inside, gathers like a lump in the 
stomach, increasing the digestive fire ( causes great hunger, appetite and 
keen power of digestion); in this Visarga Kala, people will have the 
ability to digest foods which are hard by nature, so such foods and drinks 
which are strenthening to the body should be taken properly planned; 
otherwise, the digestive fire might get increased. If such foods are not 
available, it might even devour the dh'\tus (tissues) itself; with their 
(or dhatus) decrease or loss, Vnta gets increased (aggravated) in associa­
tion with the internal heat during this cold season. ( 8-13 1 / 2)

So during Hemafita, foods which are fatty, having sweet, sour and 
salt taste predominantly should be taken; flesh of animals which live 
in burrows, water and marshy places; those which prey upon others . 
for food, and animals which are specially fed: (for the sake of food); 
fresh liquors prepared with treacle and flour, products of ma~a, sugarca­
ne and milk, muscle-fat, oil and freshly harvested grains should be used 
Chapter 4 
as food; exercises, massage, oil bath, sudation, inhalation of smoke, 
basking in the sun, warm water for washing; residing in houses which 
are under the ground, or equipped with ovens, bedding made of thick 
cotton and wollen blankets; in the company of beautiful woman who 
has adorned herself which perfumes like thick paste of kuq1kuma and 
agaru and put on thin but warm cloth ( of skin or silk); getting relieved 
of the cold with warm embrace of the woman having well developed 
parts of the body and thus get over the cold and breeze.. ( 14-18 1 /2) 
Notes:-The term guru' in thccontcxt offood refers both to large quantity and difficulty 
for digestion. Sveda orsudation arc the methods to produce perspiration such a shot water 
bath etc.; keeping· with a woman in the bed implies sexual intercourse also. ,

During Sisira ttu, the cold gets increased still more by the clouds, 
bre~ze and rain; dryness also will be found, it being the commencement 
of Adana kala; all the regimen described above for Hemarita tlu should 
be adopted n1ore rigoursly and in greater measure during this B,t u. ( l 9) 
Vasaiit~rtu carya (rcgilncn for spring): 
During Vasaiitha ttu, the wind blows from the south, the sun's rays 
JJtucarya adhyaya 
are coppery red in colour; the trees are full of fresh spouts, bark and 
leaves; all the quarters (area all round} are clean and clear; trees like 
kiqisuka, asoka, ct.Ha and others adorn the fore st kingdom; which 
reverberates with the pleasant sound of the cus:koo, bees etc. The slcrma 
(Kapha) which has accumulated during the Sisira (:r;-tu} gets increased 
still more by the effect of the hot sun, produces many diseases, by 
hampering the digestive activity. 
So, administration or use of digestive emetics, inhalations, mouthga­
rgles, nasal medication, exercise, massage; honey, barley, wheat and 
soup of meat of animals of the desert-like regions should be resorted 
to. Day-time should be spent in gardens in the company of friends and 
beautiful women who have taken bath, anonited their bodies with 
perfumes such as paste of cafidana and aguru and put on good dress 
and ornaments; fresh sahakara (mango juice mixed with sugar), fresh 
and pure asava, ari~ta, sfdhu, mardvika and madhava (different kinds 
of alcoholic beverage) kept in beautiful pots and served in different 
kinds of good looking vessels; water boiled with musta and sunthi, 
ararfibu ( water processed with decoction of pith of trees such as asana, 
khadira, cafidana), madhvarfibu (water mixed with honey) should be used 
for drinking. Foods which are guru (hard to digest and more in quantity) 
and srta (cold}; sleeping during day, materials which are fatty, sour and 
sweet should be avoided.(23-26 1 /2) 
Notes:- In Sisira .rtu, Kapha gets slightly incresed inside the body due to cold and will 
accumulate in thick consistence in many places. When the next season Vasaiita dawns, 
the heat of the sun gradually increases and Jiquifies the thick Kapha which fills up the 
tissues and cavities of the body by its increased volume. Left as such it leads on to the 
production of many diseases, so it should be removed out by force by emesis, inhalation 
olstrong smoke, mouth gargles and nasal drops or reduced by indulgence in exercise etc. 
asava. ari$fa_. sidhu_. mardvika and madhava are all mild.alchoholic drinks; asava and 
ari$fffs are prepared by fermenting infusions and decoctions respectively with addition 
of molasses; mardvika is prepared from grapes and mad ha va from honey; sanimbha is 
watermadefragrantbyaddingextractsoftreesofastringentandbittertaste.Alltheabove 
drinks and waters are intended to reduce thekapha in the body.

In Gri~ma ~tu, the sun's rays appear like that of flowers of atasr (light 
blue in colour) and arc very hot; fire breaks out in the forests; the 
quarters and the earth seem to be burning with heat but the breeze from 
the southwest is comfotablc; all the animals feel like suffering from 
fever by the effect of the hot wind. sun and consequent sweating; the 
water of rivers, ponds, lakes etc., arc made dirty by elephants, buffaloes 
and other animals dipping themselves in water to reduce their heat; the 
quantity of water gets reduced hy the strong heat of the sun; rivers appear 
promincn t in their em bankmcnts (but with very Ii ttlc water), trees have 
no shade under them because of falling of ripened leaves; the leaves, 
bark and cntwinning creepers arc all dried up. 
The sun being very hot takes away (v.·ithdraws) the strength of the 
earth (of all things on this earth) during this season; so people should 
avoid exercise, basking in the sun. substances which possess pungent, 
sour and salt tastes and hot ( or producing heat i nsidc L alcoholic drinks 
should not be taken. or taken in very little quantity or with addition 
,8tucarya adhyaya 
of large quantity of water, otherwise it will produce oedema, looseness 
of the joints, burning sensations and delusion; syrups, thin gruels 
prepared with corn flour and sugar which are very sweet in taste and 
smell, kept in ·fresh mud pots are the ideal drinks. The food should be 
sweet, cold and liquid; meat of animals and birds living in desert-like 
regions, rice, milk, ghee, grapes, coconut water, sugar are to be made 
use of; cool breeze from fan prepard from the leaves of palm trees, 
head dress of garlands prepared from petals of lotus and lily should 
be worn; the company of women who are of thin build, adorned with 
garland of lotus, and anointed with the paste of sandal wood will be 
advisable; so also beautiful lakes, wells, (ponds·), rivers and fores ts 
which are cool and spreading pleasant fragrance are goodf or recreation; 
dress should be of very thin cloth and sprinkled with perfumes. It is 
best to sleep in apartment equipped with water fountains during day 
and during nights in an open area with sweet smelling flowers all around 
and in the company of a lady who has anointed herself with comphor 
and sandal paste. But sexual intercourse with her not being frequent.

steps of ponds and lakes become covered with fresh water, the lotus 
buds open out by the frequent rain fall; the rivers appear like ocean, 
the demarcation of land area and area of water are not clear, pleasnat 
sounds from the clouds, peacocks and frogs are heard constantly; the 
earth shines with indragopa ( cochineal) insects (insects with bright red 
coloured fur crawling on the ground) rainbow and lightenings; green 
grass, mushrooms and kutaja trees with flowers are found all around; 
the strength of men being reduced by the effect of the season, the 
digestive capacity also becomes less and troubles the person (with 
indigestion), by the effect of rain, vapour of the earth, water and air, 
the food materials undergo sour digestion. So, resort to the use of bas ti 
(enemas) should be done after proper purificatory prodedures; old rice, 
wheat and barley, soup of pulses processed with ginger, oil etc., pure 
and good madira, ari~ta and mardvika diluted with little quantity ofwater 
should be used; rain water, or water of wells, or water collected from 
depressions in rocks and water of lakes should be boiled well and used; 
as the days are full of rains and wind the food should be such which 
. reduces moisture and Vata in the body; when it is cloudy, substances 
which are dry, easy to digest, fatty, hot, sour and salt should be used 
as food and drink along with honey and well processed ( with' oil, ginger, 
pepper etc.). The place of dwelling should be free from snakes, (scorpins 
etc.,) fumes from the earth, cold breeze and drizzle; equpped with fire 
places, devoid of. musquitoes and rats which bite. Squeeezing and 
massaging of the body, bath, inhalation of smoke, scents such as of 
aguru should be resorted to; while going out, riding on a female elephant 
and such other vehicles is ideal, wearing of beautiful garlands and dress 
are good; river water, mixture of water and flour, sleeping during day, 
liquid foods, sexual intercourse, dew, walking by foot, exercise and 
exposure to sun rays should be avoided. (38-49)

In Sa.rat i;tu, the sky is clear of clouds, the earth is full of slush, kasa 
grass, saptahva, water lily and paddy saplings; with the absence of 
clouds, the sunrays are spreading wide and are hot, the quarters (space 
all around) appear reddish brown, very clear and with krauiica birds 
( curlews) --flying in formation resembling garlands; lakes ponds having 
waves raised by the fish moving underneath · the lotus leaves and 
movement of swans; the water of the ponds etc., is clear. 
Pitta which has accumulated in the body by the effect of cold of the 
Varsa i;tu, gets further increased by the sudden heat of the sunsrays 
in this season; hence it is very ideal to have a drink of medicated ghee 
which is bitter in taste, resort to purgatives and blood letting frequently; 
the foods and drinks should be cold, easy to digest, less in quantity 
with astringent, sweet and bitter tastes; rice, sa~tika rice (which matures 
in sixty days) wheat, barley, green-gram, sugar, honey, patola, amalaka 
drak~a and meat of animals of the desert-like regions are good foods 
for those who have very good hunger; water made warm by sun's rays 
in the afternoons and cooled by moonlight at nights and which is pleasant 
(clean), removed of poisonous effect by the rising of Agastya constella­
tion; such pure, clear water boiled (and cooled) is as ideal as nectar 
itself for drinking in this season. 
Day-time should be spent in sailing in lakes which are full of swans, 
Chapter4 
rows of humming bees, and blossomed lotus flowers; wearing light and 
clean dress, garlands, anointing the body with the paste of usrra which 
is coolant; nights should be spent on a terrace having good moonlight. 
Over-satiation, curds, sunlight, alkaline substances, muscle-fat, oils, 
eastern breeze, strong alcholic drinks, sleeping during day and snowfall 
should be avoided.(50-59 1 /2) 
Notes :-Agastya is the name of a star, (canopus) which appears in the sky on the 
seventh day ol the second hall of the month olBhadrapada (midAug_ust to Mid-Septe­
mber) and continues to shine for about two months. Hindu astronomy states that its 
rays have the effect of detoxicating poisons and so water kept exposed at nights during 
this period is equal to nectar. The term. 'Hamsodaka' means pure w;iter and can be 
applied to any water which is filtered and made potable.

A healthy person should cultivate the habit of eating foods of all the 
six tastes daily (all through the year) specially so of the particular tastes 
indicated in each season. ( 60) 
Notes :-Foods of all the six tastes need not be of equal quantities, the staple food 
like rice, wheat, jawar etc., which are sweet will have to be more in quantity; curry_. 
soup, vegetables, pickles etc., which are adjuvants usually prepared by adding chillies, 
spices, salt, oil ghee; etc._. are predominantly sour_. pungent and salty. Sugar. jaggery 
honey, jams are the sweets; vegetables like bitter gourd_. leaves of methika which are 
bitter should also be included in the diet. Though substances of astringent tastes are 
not favoured as foods, yet many articles of daily use also contain some amount of 
astringency. Hence, the common daily diet of India. is a judicious blend of all the 
six tastes. It has been so designed and put to practice since many centuries _. with special 
attention, paid to promotion and maitainance of health of the people all the year. The 
only care expected of the people, is that they should not become too much fond of 
any one or two tastes and reject others.

The last and first seven days of the i;-tus (preceding and fallowing) 
are together known as ~itusaii.dhi ( meeting of two seasons). During this 
.Qtucarya adhyaya 
period the regimen of the previous season should be discontinued 
gradually and those of the succeding season adopted slowly. If, on 
the other hand, they are discontinued or adopted suddenly, diseases 
due to unaccoustomed foods and activities develop.( 61-61 1 /2.) 
Notes :-The last seven days of the disappearing season and the first seven days of 
the next appearing season making a fortnight is suffi"cient enough to discontinue the 
old regimen and adopt the new one gradually . . ~AA: ~~~~-1i 11~~11

The rules and regimen so far described for each season is meant only 
. for persons who are healthy; for others (sick persons) separate regimen 
will be described later, while eloborating abnormalities (diseases). ( 6 2)

The qualities of the seasons are to be understood in respect of three 
aspects viz. Masa (months) Rasi (stellar constellations) and Svariipa 
( characteristic features); the regimen prescribed for each season should 
be followed in mild, moderate or full degree in the succeeding order 
of strength. ( 63) 
Notes :-The details of the three aspects of the seasons are as follows:Masas (months) 
1. Magha + Phalguna 
2. Caitra + Vaisakha 
3. Jre$fa + A$iI</ha 
4. Sraval}a + Bhadrapada 
5. Aswilia {Ja) + Kartika 
6. Margasira + Pau$a Rasis (constellations) 
Makara + Kumbha

Kanya+ Tula 
Vrscika + Dhanus Rtus (seasons) 
Sisira 
Vasaiita 
Grf$ma 
'far$a 
Sarat 
Hemaiita 
Svarupa means the characteristic features special to each season. The appearance 
of all the three (masa, rasi and svarapa) do not correctly coincide often. Some times 
masa will have commenced but rasi will not have, sometimes the features of the season 
will not have started and so on. So importance is given first to the appearance ofSvarOpa 
(special features) in reckoning the season, then to the rasi-(constellation) and last to 
the masa (month). The regimen prescrib.ed for the season should be mild or part, if 
only masa has commenced without commencement of rasi as svarOpa; it should be 
Chapter4 
moderate if nisi has commenced but svarapa has not yet; and regimen should in f'ull 
measure if svarapa (features) has commenced even without rasi. There are two methods 
of calculating the calender in our country, the souramana (according to the movement 
of the sun) and the c3ndram3na {according to the movement of the moon), the fromer 
is followed in north India while the latter in south India. There is a slight difference 
between the two, in respect of appearance of months, seasons etc. 
In a vast country like India, the characteristic features of the seasons are also no_t 
uniform. In some places every feature manifests in full vigour throughout, while in 
some others, only a few features manifest moderately and in yet others, somefeaturess 
may manifest mildly or not at all. The Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan regions in the 
northern-most part of India wilJ be having rain and cold in more times of the year; 
but it is heat and more heat as we travel to southern parts of the country. In ancient 
times, a convenient method of dividing India into three regions for reckoning the seasons 
was (a) area and to the northern side of the river Ganga (Himalayan and sub-Himalayan 
regions) (b) areas to its southern side (Ganga-Yamuna basin, central Indian plaetau) 
and (c) area south of the Vindhya mountains , (the Deccan Plaetau). The season of 
heavy rain in the north was even given a new name as Pravrt rtu comprising ofAsa<fha 
and SravaJJa months (mid-June to mid-August) and placed in between Gi'$ma and Varsa 
rtus. So it is for the people of the geographical area to be conversant with the features 
of the seasons of that area and to follow the regimen appropriately. 
Before closing this chapter, it is also necessary to know the relationship between 
the Stus and and three dO$BS of the human body. As stated earlier the dO$BS undergo 
Caya (mild increase) Prakopa (profoud increase) and Prasama (decrease to normalcy) 
in different seasons. It is essential for the physician to have good knowledge of this 
order to adopt suitable remedial measures to prevent diseases that might arise from 
such increased dO$BS. The following table shows the change of the do$BS in different 
seasons.

The urges of the flatus, faeces, urine, sneeze, thirst, hunger, sleep, 
cough, heavy breathing on exertion, yawn, tears, vomitting and seminal 
discharge, should not be suppressed. (2) 
Notes -These are the normal activities of the body and intended to eliminate -unwanted 
materials . The process of such elimination is a chain reaction initiated and carried 
out by the nervous system; suppressing it in the middle not only-stops the elimination 
of waste products but also brings about strain and disorders of the nervous system 
leading to the production of many diseases. These develop in those who are in the 
habit of suppressing the urges over Jong periods of time and not immediately. It is 
very necessary to respond to the natural urges of the body when they appear and not 
control them, to prevent diseases.

Splitting pain all over the body, formation of urinary stones, pain in 
the urinary bladder, penis and groins and even the other diseases 
mentioned earlier develop by the suppression of the urge of urine. ( 5) 
The treatment for these conditions are :use of guda varti (rectal suppositories), oil-massage, hip-bath, fome­
ntation, administration of enemas, and use off oods which help elimina­
tion of faeces, are to be adopted in disorders due to suppression of 
faeces; in disorders due to suppression of urge of urine, drinking of 
pure ghee in large doses both before taking of the food and after the 
digestion of food are indicated. This method is known as Avapiqaka. 
Notes :-Guda varti ( rectal suppositories) arc prepared from purgative drugs and 
arc small and rod shaped bits. The.r arc luhric.ucd with oil. ghcc or any other grcas_r

Just as silt develops surely, in course of time, even in pure water kept 
undisturbed in a earthenpot, so also (dirt accumulates) inside the body; 
hence it should be removed from the body at appropriate times.(26) 
Notes:-Inspite of adhering to the regimen of the different seasons, little quantities 
of waste materials and mild abnormalities of the three do$aS will be found in the body 
always. These will not give rise to diseases quickly because of thier poor strength but 
if allowed to accumulate for Jong time, they gain strength and cause many diseases. 
So periodical removal of these abnormal materials should be done by purificatory 
measures such as emesis, purgation etc.

The do~as, undergoing increase slowly, in the body of such persons, 
who are negligent of taking purificatory measures, produce many disea­

Roganutpadaniya Adhyaya 
Obesity, poor digestive capacity, diabetes, leprosy, toxic fevers, 
obstruction of the tissue pores ( or passages, channels of the body), 
debility of the sense organs, difficulty in breathing, oedema, anaemia, 
accumulation of undigested materials, stiffness of the legs, enlargement 
of the abdomen, severe digestive disorders like Alasaka and DaIJ.qaka, 
vomitting, enlargement of (lymph) glands, intestinal parasites, tumors, 
lassitude; appearance of bad dreams, diseases of the throat, headache; 
loss of intellegence, sleep, complexion, colour and strength even thouh 
taking nourishing foods-all these diseases develop in the body because 
the channels of the rasadhatu (nutrient tissue) will have become coated 
with the increased do~as (or by accumulation of wastes). Hence in order 
to promote health it is necessary to prescribe vomitting and other 
purificatory measures suitably. 
Do~as which have been mitigated by fa sting and use of digestive drugs, 
are likely to increase once again; but those (do~as) conquered by 
purificatory measures will never increase again. 
So, after adopting purificatory measures, rejuvinating tonics and 
efficient aphrodisiacs should be administered as suited to the times, 
(season and age). (27-34a) 
Notes:-The three do$as-Vata, Pitta and Kapha- are constantly undergoing change 
by th~ effect of seasons, foods and activities, etc. They usually undergo slight increase 
in quantity in healthy persons and decrease back to normal by tht; daily foods and 
activities which are opposite of their qualities. Such mild increase, though incapable 
of producing diseases in the body quickly, may do so, after some time, if allowed 
to accumulate. The channels of nutrition of the tissues become blocked either partially 
or completely by the accumulated do$3S causing obstruction to the movement of the 
nutrition into the tissues. This is the stage of commencement of disease. Hence in 
order tu prevent this and restore normalcy (health) it is essential to control the do$8S 
and bring them back to normal. 
There '!re two methods of treatment for bringing the increased do$aS back to normal 
viz., (a) Samana (palliative) mitigating the increase by avoidance of food, administration 
of drugs of opposite quality etc., .(b) Sodhana- (purificatory) removing the increased 
and accumulated do$8S, out of the body forcibly by emesis, purgation etc.; of these . 
two, the former is slow and gives temporary effect and hence not ideal, while the 
latter is quick, gives permanent effect, hence condidered best. But sodhana measures 
cannot be done in all persons, at all times and in all conditions. So samana measures 
Chapter S 
are al£o important and useful where sodhana.can not be done.

be given nourishing foods gradually. Foods prepared with rice, sa~tika 
(rice which ripens in sixty days), wheat, meat, milk, ghee etc., made 
tasty, pleasing and easily digestible by addition of drugs are ideal. 
Oil-bath, massages, bath, use of oil enema and decoction enemas and 
such other measures help in improving their digestive capacity, intellige­

exogenous, caused by other animals {big or minute). weapons. the, electricity and

the body, mind and speech), controlling the activities of the sense organs, 
proper knowledge of the habitat, season and ones own self ( constitution, 
temperament); adopting the regimen of right living, performing propitia­
tory rites prescribed by Atharva veda, worshipping planets and stars 
which are malevalent to oneself, and avoiding the contact of evil spirtits, 
etc.-these are specific methods-described not only to prevent the origin 
of diseases but also to cure those which have already manifest.(38-41) 
Notes :-Prajnaparadha is a technical term in Ayurveda, used to mean intentional 
trangression or violation of normal or usual activities of the body (kayaka), mind 
{manasika) and speech {vacika); in three ways, such as atiyoga {over-activity), ayoga 
{inactivity) and mithya-yoga {perverse activity). This has been described in detail in 
chapter 22. 
Propitiatory rites prescribed by Atharva veda are performanc~ of Yajna {sacrifices), 
offering of oblations, giving donations, observing -vows. wearing of gems, amulets; 
going on pilgrimage etc. Contact of evil-spirits can be avoided by scrupilous adherance 
to cleanliness {both external- {bodily) and internal-(mental); study of scriptures, 
following the path of rightousness (dharma} in all activities, keeping away from the 
company of bad persons and objects etc. 
All the above are mentioned here to instruct the healthy person to av_oidall activities 
which are harmful to the body and adopt such of them which are helpl'ul to promote 
and maintain his health.

Indulgence in suitable foods activities daily, doing all activities carefu­
lly considering their good and bad, not getting engrossed too mucl) in 
sensory pleasures, giving donations ( to the needy), treating all living 
beings equally (with compassion), fallowing the path of truth, forgiving 
the mistakes of others and keeping the company of good, learned men-all 
these make a person live a disease-free life.(43) 
Not attempting to obtain such objects which are unattainable, not 
disregarding those which are readily available, keeping control over 
one's sense organs, makes a person free from diseases, except of course 
by the will of gods (providence). ( 44) 
Notes :-Attempting to obtain things or pleasures which are beyoi1ds one's power 
or capacity, at all costs, and getting disappointed by failure in such atempts will be 
utter foolishness; similarly not being satisfied with what he already has with him, 
belittling its good qualifies and getting discontented with it, is also foolishness. Both 
are to be avoided to keep -up good health. Inspite of following all the rules of health, 
man becomes a victim of diseases caused by proidence {effects of past lives, wrath 
o[gods etc.) which is beyond human comprehension. '

Favourable time, sense objects which are pleasing to the mind, 
righteous activities which bestow happiness, mind under control and 
clear intellect-these, in a courageous person, always provide happi­
ness. ( 45) 
Notes:-'Favourable time' means the seasons of the year having their normal features 
without variations. 'sense objects' means the subjects of the five sense organs such 
as sound. touch. sight. taste and smell; 'rightous activities' are those which are 
prescribed by the .scriptures as good to one and all; mind 'under control'. is one that 
is not swayed away by emotions but which is steadfast. and 'clear intellect' is that 
which arrives at a decision after careful discrimination. All these are ideal for promotion 
, of health and attainment of happiness.

the properties of the land and becomes healthy or unhealthy depending on the nature 
of the land. 
In olden days, rain water used to be pure. But now a days with the increasing 
industrialisation, the atmosphere has become contaminated with poisonous gases etc., 
that rain water coming down from the clouds gets polluted to a great extent. Because 
of this we hear of salty rain, acid rain, crimson rain and so on occasionally. It is harmful 
to make use of such rain water for drinking without boiling it .

Only that rain water which neither makes the cooked sali rice kept 
rice kept in a clean silver plate too moist (slimy) nor change its colour 
is to be considered good for drinking. All other kinds of water are called 
as Samudra (sea water) and should not be used for drinking except during 
Asvayuja month.(5-5 1 /2) 
Notes:-Good rain water collected in a clean silver vessel,· if poured over the cooked 
rice and allowed to stand for a few minutes should not alter the normal bright white 
colour of rice. This was the test being carried out in olden days to determine the 
suitability of rain water for drinking. Water which did not stand this test was considered 
bad just as sea water and so categorically named as such, even though it is not got 
from the sea directly. Such water is allowed for drinking only during the month of 
8svayuja (mid-,, september) because of the presence of the star 'Agastya '(Conopus) 
which detoxicates poisons) but not in other seasons.

Rail~ water collected by burowing the earth, or from a pit in a stone

In the absence of such water (good rain water), water from the earth 
which resembles it (having qualities similar to rain water) should be 
used. (7) 
Dravadravya Vijiianiya Adhyaya 
Notes:-Burrowing the earth should be done a little deep and water,collected after 
a few minutes. If it is intended to collect water from pits in rocks, it is necessary 
to clean the rock pit before the rains. Water should be filtered through il clean cloth 
into the vessel, which should be kept undisturbed for some time to allow sediments, 
to settle down at the bottom of the vessel. As it is difficult to obtain such pure rain-water 
all through the year, any pure water collected from other sources such as rivers, lakes, 
ponds or wells, having quali~ies similar to rain water can be used for drinking.

Water of the earth ( terrestrial) frQm a place having white soil will 
be astringent in taste, in a place of black soil it will be sweet, in light 
yellowish soil it will be bitter, in blue soil it is astringent-sweet; in alkaline 
soil, it will be salty, in brown soil it will be alkaline, at place of mixed 
soil it will be of mixed taste; 
If the region of the land is having the qualities of Ap bhuta predomi­
nantly, the water of that region will be sweet, if the region is predominant 
in the qualities of P~thvi bhuta, the water will be salt and sour; in regions 
which are predominantly Taijasa, the water will be bitter and pungent, 
in regions predominant of qualities of V ayu bhuta the water will be 
astringent; in regions which possess the qualities of Akasa bhuta predo­
minantly, the water will be tasteless and resembles rain water in all 
respects; The water from a clean place having black or white soil and 
fully exposed to sun-light and wind is also similar to rain water.(8-1 la) 
Notes:-Even thoµgh the earth is made up of all the PaffcabhOtas {elements) their 
proportion varies from one region to the other. Because of this, there is variation in 
the colour and qualities of the soil~ the nature of climate, flora and fauna, constitution 
and temperament of the people. etc. Hence the suitability or otherwise of water of 
different regions of the earth. People Jiving for Jong periods in a particular region 
will have become accustomed to the kind of water of that region and the water of 
other regions will not be suitable for them. water of any region well exposed to sunlight 
and air will be more suitable to health than the one which is not so exposed.

Water is the sustainer of life of all living beings, the entire world is

In conditions of Arna (ajinia) and Vi~tabdha (ajinia), the patient should 
drink warm water even though not thirsty, just enough to moisten the 
food and make it liquid. Large quantities of water will destroy the 
digestive capacity; the obstruction in the stomach caused by accumulated 
Kapha and Vata will be released and so the food liquified by hot water 
undergoes quick digestion.(35-36) 
Notes:-Amajfnia and Vi$fabdalfrna are the two kinds of indigestion caused b> 
the increase of Kapha and Vata respectively. In both, the digestive power will be very 
poor and so unable to digest the food. To aid proper digestion the food has to be 
made liquid by drinking some quantity of hot water, which kindles digestion, makes 
for normal peristalitic movements of the alimentary tract, and helps digestion of food 
quickly. Care should be taken not to drink large quantitites.

For persons who have anvasthita do~as (mild increase of do~as which 
are moving from place to place); those who have poor digestive capacity 
and those who have become weak after illnesses, even little quantity 
of un-cooked water will not be good, as it will cause increa~e of all 
the three do~as. (37) 
Notes:-The do$aS, after undergoing increase do not continue to stay in their normal 
places but begin to spread to other places also. This is the stage of commencement 
of disease. At such time un-cooked water, however small in quantity, will cause further 
increase of dO$BS and so should be a voided. ,

If such persons desire wate-r inevitably, they 1nay drink small quantity 
of medicated water. Even healthy persons should drink little quantities 
of water daily, except during Sarat and Nidagha :r;tus (summer). 
(38-391/2) 
Notes:- Medicated water is prepared by boiling it with drugs suitable for the 
treatment of particular diseases prescribed in the texts. During sarat and niddgha 
(grl~ma)rtus {summer) the climate being hot, drinking more quantities of water will 
not harm the body but will help maintain the water balance.

Drinking of water just before the commencement of meals causes 
weakness of the digestion and emaciation of the body; taken at the end 
of the meals it makes for obesity and accumulation of Kapha in the parts 
above the stomach; taken at the middle of the meals it maintains the 
normalcy of the tissues and helps easy digestion. ( 40-41) 
Notes:-Water taken before meals dilutes all the digestive juices making for poor 
digestion which in turn leads to inadequate nourishment and consequent wasting of 
the body; the same immediately after meals produces increase of Kapha, which leads 
to lazyness, excessive sleep and consequent accumulation of more fat in the body. 
Hence, it is advised to avoid drinking of water at these two times and drink moderate 
quantity of water during meals itself which is ideal for maintainance of health.

Water boiled and reduced to one-fourth, one-third and half of the 
original quantity depending upon the region, season and hard or easy 
for digestion; which is not having any foam, which does not cause any 
unpleasantness and which is clear-is the ideal one for drinking. ( 4 3) 
Notes:-It was stated in the previous chapter that in different seasons water undergoes 
changes due to climate and so is not the same all through the year in its digestibility; 
so also, in respect of land region. For example water during rainy season and from 
water Jogged regions are not easily digestible where as water during autumn or spring 
seasons and from desert lands is easily digestible. Hence boiling the water has been 
described as of three staf!dards viz., fa) if the water is thought to be very hard for 
digestion, it should be boiled and reduced to half of original quantity, (b) if it is 
moderately hard it should be reduced to two-thirds of the original quantity, (c) if it 
is slightly hard for digestion, it should be boiled and reduced to three fourth of the 
original quantity. Water boiled by the above standards ;will become easy for digestion 
and good for health.

undergone purificatory therapies and those suffering from early stages 
of fevers; hot water stimulates digestion, cooks the undigested mate­

(tract). 
Water made warm by immersing into it heated balls of stone, silver,

Boiled and cooled water is easily digestible and removes fatigue; it 
is ideal in disorders of combination of Pitta and Kapha and also in

Boiled water kept unused for a period of one day and night, loses 
all the good effects of boiling, becomes sour after digestion and causes 
the increase of all the three dQsas.( 44-48a) 
Notes :-Generally boiled water is prescribed for those who are suffering from 
diseases, though it is good even for the healthy. Water should •be boiled in a clean 
vessel and reduced to the appropriate quantity. It should be used either hot, warm, 
lukewarm or cooled by allowing it a short time, as per the liking of the person. Boiled 
water which has become stale should not be used. Boiled water should not be made 
cool quickly by keeping it in a refrigerator or by any other means. It should be allowed 
to cool by itself slowly and then used.

Assuchitisnotgoodforthe -teethandgeneralhcalth.Refrigeratorbeingfoundnowadays 
in almost every home, the habit of using food products made by cold process is becoming 
very common. As can be guessed, very cold foods and drinks tend to increase the 
moisture of the body, lower the temperature temporarily for short periods and decrease 
the digestive juices in the alimentary tract. All these have a deleterious effect on the 
natural resistance of the body. Persons desirous of good health should avoid frequent 
Dr~vadravya Vij:iianiya Adhyaya 
use of very cold foods and drinks:, however pleasant they may be. White marble stones 
do not melt and become water. Ancient Indians attribute antitoxic, bactericidal and 
health promoting properties to this kind of stone and any water coming through it or 
coming in contact with it was believed to derive such properties. Based on this belief, 
there was the practice, in olden times of keeping a piece of white marble, immersed 
in water for purifying it. White marble is found in north India at a few places only 
and in some river beds, such as the Narmada.

Cocoanut water is unctous (lubricant), sweet, aphrodisiac, coolant, 
easily digestible; removes thirst, mitigates Pitta and Vata, stimulates 
digestion and cleanses the urinary bladder (tract).(50) 
Notes:-Cocoanut water is a very favourite drink in this country. It is a very tasty 
and refreshing beverage and especially during summer. If the nut is very unripe, the 
water will be slightly salty but more in quantity. Water of a well ripened nut is very 
sweet but its quantity will be Jess. Hence, it is ideal to select a nut which is half ripe 
and drink its sweet water in moderate quantity. Instrument used for choping the nut 
should be clean and sharp enough to cut through the fibres quickly. Water inside is 
quite sterile {free from any bacteria) and it should not be contaminated with dirty 
materials. It should be used immediately, it is not good to use it af'ter along time.

Uncooked milk is abhi~yandi ( causes exudation of moisture from tissue 
pores) and hard to digest; judiciously cooked it is easily digestible, if 
over-cooked it becomes undigestible; warm fresh (nascent) milk ( dire­

Notes:-All kinds of milk except human are used as food ol adults and occasionally 
as medicine . Human milk is mainly used as food for'infants, but its use as medicine 
for diseases of the eye is special. Milk that are to be used by adults as food has to 
be boiled before use. Boiling should be done for a few minutes but not for a Jong 
time. Boiling destroys the disease-producing bacteria that are likely to be present in 
the milk. Now-a-days the method of pastuerisation {boiling the milk and cooling it 
suddenly) is resorted, to destroy the harmful bacteria. Drinking fresh warm milk 
squeezed from the udder of the cow immediately was an ancient practice and has been 
discontinued now-a-days as not suitable to health.

Milk of animals which are fed on oil-cake of sesamum and sour 
materials is hard to digest and abhi~yaridi ( causes more exudation of 
moisture from the tissue pores). The milk drawn in the morning is hard 
to digest than the one drawn in the evening because of inactivity ( of 
the animal at nights); this is applicable to the size and contitution of 
the animal; milk of animals whic~ are small in size and very active by 
nature is easily digestible than that of animals which are of large size 
and not very active; this principle also applies to the flesh-of the 
animals.( 60-61) 
Notes:- Piqy3ka {oil-cake) is the residue obtained after the oil has been taken 
out from seasmum (til). Such residue of seeds of ground-nut {peanut), cotton_. -etc .. 
are good food to cows. They, however, alter the properties of the milk to a slight

degree, hence this indication here. Animals like goat, being small in size are very active; 
cows and buffaloes being of medium size are of moderate activity; camels, elephants

of animals of small, medium and large size are easy, hard and very difficult for digestion

will develop by partaking it. (62-65) 
Notes:-Dadhi is popularly known as curds in India. Curds become sour, after 
fermentation it is not good for health, lnspite of it, it is a popular item of diet, hence 
the above warning regarking its use; forbidding its use at nights should not be presumed 
that it can be partaken during day, even during day it should not be used daily; if 
it is to be done so it should be mixed with sugar, honey, ghee, soup of green-gram

a thin liquid. It will then become fit to be used daily along with other foods. It is an 
ideal diet in the diseases mentioned above. All Ayurvedic texts extol its good properties, 
to the extent ofsaying that "Takra is not available even to Sakra {Indra), a.t the heaven". 
It forms important item of daily diet in every Indian home. It is a nutritious and

Notes :-· New hybrid varieties of sugarcane have replaced the old varieties 
mentioned here. The sweetness of the juice varies from region to region and from 
one variety to that of other. The properties mentioned above are of the unadultarated 
fresh juice. The present day habit of adding ice cubes, lemon juice or salt to the 
sugar-cane juice alters its original properties. Sugarcane juice is an ideal drink during 
summer but not so during other seasons. Persons suffering from diabetes mellitus etc. 
should not drinkit. ,

quickly because it has been prepared even out of poisonous flowers 
and by bees which are also poisonous. 
Use of honey, which is heat _producing, is not contraindicated in 
therapies like prachardana (emesis) and ninlha (decoction enema) as 
it comes out of the body quickly without undergoing digestion. 
Because of properties like difficult dige&tability, dryness, astringency 
and noncoolant (in other words-heat .producing) honey is good only 
in little quantities; there is nothing more difficult (to cure) than the 
indigestion caused by honey (by using too much quantity); it kills the 
person quickly just like poison, because the treatment for this condition 
is contrary to the usual lines of therapy. Honey being a combination 
of many materials is the best yogavahi (ambivalent), so used along with 
aphrodisiac drugs it helps the incerase of sexual vigour. 
Bhramara, Pau·&pika, K~audra and Mak&ika varieties of honey are good 
in order of succession; Old honey is still more good, the last two Varieties 
of honey should be made use of (as far as possible).(86-93) 
~ {I q1T: I 
Thus ends the ·group of sugarcane products. 
Notes :-Honey is the sweet liquid prepared by bees for their own use but robbed 
by man. There are many varieties of bees, different in size, colour and habitat. Some 
dwe11 in forests and build their home (hive) attached to the branches of ta11 tress, 
some build them inside the crevices of the trees; they are also seen attached to the 
roofs of ta11 buildings, inside the cracks of the walls etc., generally large and medium 
sized brown coloured bees build big combs (hives) while small sized, slightly blackish 
bees build their home inside the crevices and ho11ows of threes and buildings. The 
bees go from flower to flower, dip their sharp probosis into them, suck the sweet 
liquid (nectar), store them in a special sac inside their mouth. After they come back 
to their hive in the evening, they bring out the sweet nectar and deposit it inside the 
small chambers of the comb. Thus they build up a store of readyfood for their use 
in rainy season. Man lured by its sweetness drives away the bee_sf orcebly and collects 
the honey, not caring even the strong poisonous sting of the enraged bees. Now-a-days 
bee-keeping has come into vogue, wooden hives are provided to them inside the 
gradt!'J)s and honey collected periodically without harming the bees or being harmed 
Chapter 6 
by them. 
Honey is a very sweet, thick liquid, varying in colour from dark brown to light yellow. 
The sweetness and tickness also show variations depending upon the region, type of 
flowers bees feed on, season and the variety of the bees. Honey is a mixture of nectar 
and pollen of flowers. It contains 20. 06% of water, 71.41 % of carbohydrate (in the 
from of two sugars-the dextrose and lavulose),. 0.38% ofprotien, small quantities of 
Formic acid, and Vitamin-B. It is used as a sweetening agent used along with foods 
and drinks; it is also used as a vehicle for administration of medicines, as a,supplementa­
ry diet and drug in many diseases. It can be used by all irrespective of age or sex, 
in little quantities without adding anything, daily either as such or along with other 
articles of food. It is necessary to use genuine honey always and refect the spurious 
and adultara.fed honey which are sold cheap in the market. Genuine honey is slightly 
transparent, clear liquid without any precipitate at the bottom of the bottle, and forms 
a uniform solution when poured into clean water.

Tailas ( oils) are generally similar (in properties) to their source 
(oil-seed); of them the chief is that of tila (sesamum). 
Tila tai1a 
Oil of sesamum possesses 'the properties like tik~na (penetrating deep 
into the tissues), vyavayi (spreading throughout the body fast), it 
produces diseases of the skin, is bad to the eyes; siik~ma ( capable of 
entering into even minute pores), hot in potency, not increasing Kapha, 
it makes lean persons fatty and fat persons lean, is constipating, kills 
worms; with appropriate processing it cures all diseases; by constant 
use of oil, the kings of Daityas (Rak~asas and other non-Aryans) of 
ancient times, were not getting old (soon), were free from diseases,

Notes :-'taila, specially means the oil of tila (sesa_mum) and used in that sense 
itselfat allplaces in ancient books ofAyurveda {and even ofgeneral sanskrit literature) 
unless specified differantly. The use of seamum oil for cooking is gradually becoming 
Jess in recent times and oil of groundnut {peanut), coconut, mustard, rape seeds, 
soyabean, sunflower etc have been brought to use. In the context of Ayurveda, it is 
sesamum oil only that should be used for internal administration and far the preparation 
of medicated oils. Many other kinds of oils of medicinal value are described further 
on.

Oil of eraIJ.cJa (castor seeds), is bitter, pungent and sweet in taste, 
laxtive, very hard to digest, cures scrotal hernia, abdominal tumors, 
diseases caused by Vata and Kapha, enlargement of abdomen, intermitant 
fevers, and pain and swellings of the waist, genitals, abdomen and back. 
Oil of red variety of castor seeds is still more penetrating, hot in 
potency and sticky and has a bad smell.(97-98) 
Notes:- Castor oil is used for medicinal purposes to produce purgations, to relieve 
pains and reduce swelling etc., it is an efficient vatahara drug {mitigates the increased 
Vata) and so very useful in diseases such as amavata {rheumatism) arusthambha {stiffness 
of the legs) and many other nervous disorders. It is administered either alone or along 
with other drugs both internally an externally. Its another common use is for abhyanga 
or oil-bath.

in taste and cleanses the ulcers; oils of tuvaraka and aru~kara are 
powerfully hot in potency. highly penetrating, pungent, destroyers of 
worms and leprosy especially and cause purgations in both the upper 
and lower parts of the body (in other words vomitting and purgations). 
Oil obtained from ak~a, atimutaka (madhavr phala) ak&oda, nalikera

Vasa (muscle-fat) and Majja (bone-marrow) both mitigate Vata, 
increase strength, Pitta and Kapha; they are similar in properties With 
the muscle (flesh) from which they are taken out; even fat (body-fat) 
also is similar in properties. 
The muscle-fat derived from bailiikf (a kind of fish) saukarr (pig) 
pakaharilsa (a kind of swan) and of the kukkuta (cock) are the best in 
those groups; But that of kumbhrra (crocodile) mahi~a (buffalo) kakama­
dgu (black waterhen) and karaQqa (water duck} are bad in their groups. 
Out of animals which feed on plants the body-fat of goat is the best 
and that of the elephant is worst. ( 106-108) 
Thus ends the group of oils. 
Notes :-Vasa is the thin fatty material found inside the folds of the muscles, 
Majja is the thick liquid marrow present inside the bones and Medas is the yellow 
coloured solid fat present underneath the skin. All these are used for Snehana ( oleation 
therapy) and hence their inclusion under this group of oils. These substancesevn though 
highly lubricative, they also have some of the other properties in accordance with the 
nature of animals from which they are obtained.

Madya (wines) in general, stimulate digestion, help taste, (appetite) 
penetrate deep, hot in potency, give satisfaction (mental) and nouri­
shment (to the body), slightly sweet, bitter and pungent in ta_ste, sour 
at the end of digestion; laxative, slightly astringent, confer good voice, 
health, intellegence, colour and complexion; easily digestable, benefi­
cial to those having loss of sleep or excess sleep, both to lean and stout 
persons; is nonviscid, capable of entering through minute pores, and 
cleansing them; mitigte v~ta and Kapha; all these benefits accrue if used 
judiciously, but used otherwise, they act like poison. 
-Fresh ones are hard to digest, make for increase of all the do&as 
whereas old ones are opposite of this. They should not be used hot or 
along with hot comforts; not by persons who are having purgations (or 
had purgative therapy) and who are hungry; Wines which are very strong 
or very weak, which are very clear (like water) or very turbid and those 
which are spoilt, should not be used for drinking.( 109-112 1 /2) 
Notes :-The term 'mad ya' refers to all types of alcoholic beverages in general. 
The practice o[ drinking alcoholic bevarages is very ancient in our country going as 
far back as the times of the Sgveda (2000 B. CJ preparing and drinking many kinds 
of wines sometimes alone some times in groups and assemblles was very common 
then. So also even today. Alcoholic beverages produce exhilaration and a sort of mental 
exuberance, hence their popularity, even as a tonic lor health. But the good effects 
ar.e slight compared to the quantity -:onswned to preduce them. So people go on increasing 
the quantity of the drink, day after day and finally become addicted to it so greatly, -
that it is impossible to be without it even for a few hours. Large quantities of such 
drinks produce many abnormalitiis in the various organs and their functions, and cause 
incurable diseases and even death. Having understood this, ancient.scholars prescribed 
many rules and regimen [or taking alcoholic drinks in order to protect the health; such 
as "it should be little, should be taken after food and never on empty stomach; taken 
in the company of good friends and not alocne, "etc. Followed strictly these wiJJ a void 
much of the bad effects of such drinks.

fermenting the liquid. It is white in colour and thick in consistence. that prepared with 
juice of kharjura (date palm), tala (wild palm) etc., is Varuqi. The thick precipate 
of sura is faga/a, still thicker is Medaka and the very thick deposit is bakkasa (kiJJwa 
or surabrja). None of these are being used now-a days.

Sukta causes increase the moisture of rakta (blood) Pitta and Kapha, 
makes Vata to move downwards, causes heart-burn, highly penetrating 
and ver-y hot in potency; good to the heart (or mind), improves taste, 
is laxative, kindles digestion, cold to touch and cures anaemia, diseases 
of the eye and worms: , 
Sukta prepared with gu(ja (molasses jaggery), sugar-cane juice, madya 
(wine) and grapes are easily digestable in order of succession, sukta 
prepared from tubers, roots and fruits bear the same properties as their 
raw materials; sal}Qaki (prepared from leafy vegetables) and kalamla 
(sukta which has become sour by passage of time) are stimulators of 
taste and easily digestable. 
Dhanyamla splits solidified materials inside the body, is penetrating, 
hot in potency, increases Pitta, is cold to touch, relieves exhoustion 
(fatigue after exercise), debility (fatigue even without exercise), stimu­
lates taste and digestion, relieves pain of the urinary bladder, is suitable 
for administration as enema into the rectum, good for the heart ( or 
mind), easily digestable and mitigates Vata and Kapha. 
Sauviraka and Tu~odaka have also similar properties, and cure worms, 
diseases of the heart, abdominal tumors, haemorrhoids and anaemia. 
They are prepared from dehusked barely and barley with husk respecti­
vely.( 129-134)

bitter in taste, cures hicup, difficulty in breathing; The dung of mrga 
(deer) prevents loss of ojas (essence of all the dhatus); that of vai~kira 
birds cures diseases caused by Vata, that of prasaha bird cures epilepsy 
and insanity; that of animals of large size ( wild animals) cures leprosy 
and other skin diseases; that of animals which live in water cures diseases 
of the eye and mitigates the increased Pitta. ( 13 9-141)

and antipoisonous; that coming from their liver (gall) increases appetite, 
bitter and wards off sin.

Notes:- MaJJ</a, peya, vilepi and odana are preparations of rice-or other grains cooked 
in water. The thin fluid resembling water drained out immediately alter boiling is known 
as MaJJ<Ja; slightly thicker than May<ja but still only liquid is peya; the next stage with 
more of solid grains and Jess ol fluid is called Vilepi and the last stage which is solid 
without only f1uid portion is known as odana. The solid one -the odana -is easily 
digestible, its earlier one the vilepi -is more ea/ily digestible, its previous one -the

Leaves, flowers, fruits (unripe), tubular leaves and tubers are difficult 
to digest in their successive order; jivaritr is the best and sarsapa the• 
worst among the leafy vegetables. ( 165) 
Thus ends the group of vegetables. 
Notes:-About 174 kinds ol vegetables have been described in these verses. Some 
of them are recognisable while some others are not. Some of them were in use in 
olden days but not so nowadays. Some are available only in forest and fields while 
some others are cultivated. All are not found or used in all the parts ol the country; 
It is also difficult in some cases to know the particular part of the plant used as food, 
because the term S3ka is not specific and is applied to mean vegetables in a general 
sense. It can be presumed that leaves, tender sprouts, 17owers, shoots, fruits (unripe), 
stalks of tubers, tubers and seeds were being used. Most of them and most ol the 
times were being consumed well cooked but some were eaten uncooked also. Many 
varieties of soups, curry and side-dishes are prepared with them, chief1y as adjuvants 
to the staple food, to increase appetite. They are consumed in small quantities only, 
but should not be substituted for the staple food. 
Many of the vegetables which are common now-a-days are not found in the above 
list. For example: tomato, cabbage, caulif1ower, beetroot, etc. Their qualities and 
properties can be understood by repeated usage and carefully recognising their effects 
in the body. It should also be borne in mind that all vegetables will not produce the 
same effect to the same degree in all persons, as the constitution of every person is 
different. A vegetable which may cause constipation in one person may not do so in 
the other. So every person should take note of the good or bad effects of every vegetable 
he uses and become accustomed to those which do not harm him and avoid those which 
cause harm. Using them well cooked is always good and those which are used raw 
should be cleaned w~JJ with good water, and outer skin removed. It is ideal to use 
only fresh vegetables.

Among the two varieties of Paravata fruit (sweet and sour) that 
of sweet taste is cold iri potency while that of sour taste is hot; 
both are hard to digest, improve taste and mitigate excess digestive 
activity. 
Aruka fruit improves taste, sweet, ripened fruit undergoes dige­

and increases the do~as. 
Drak~a and Paru~aka in their moist state are sour, increase Pitta

Fruits of Amlika and Ankola improve digestion, break the hard 
faeces, cure thirst, fatigue, weakness, are• easily digestible and

Accustomed foods, drinks and drugs will give immediate strength,

Therapies like Yamana (emesis) are contraindicated for the obese,

Unboiled/uncooked buttermilk mitigates Kapha inside the stomach but

Milk is sweet, laxative and cold in potency; curds is opposite of all 
these but ghee is similar to milk -these variations are due to the time 
factor. 
Milk and curds mitigate Vata generally but the curds, not well formed, 
will cause increase of Vata; butter-milk which is both astringent and 
sour is constipating wheraas that which is only sour is purgative. • 
Flowers of dhataki, jaggery and water are the causes (raw materials)

Udamaritha (a drink prepared by stirring cornflour in large quantity

of purgatives should be resorted to for six days each in succeeding order, 
after taking into consideration the strength or otherwise of the do~as. 
(244) 
Notes-:- During the course of treatment for fevers. the normal procedure is to 
administer only a thin gruelfor the fi"rst six days. decoction of drugs for the next ·six 
days and so on. The reason for mentioning it here is to point out that the physician. 
need not be very rigid about the specific duration of time but can either discontinue 
that regimn beyond six days depending upon the strength of the abnormality of the· 
do$aS. It is his own correct judgement of the condition of the do~as which should become 
the criterion of prescribing.

For persons suffering from vomitting, heart diseases and abdominal 
tumors, emesis is prescribed in treatment, though it is contra-idicated;

persons .r;uffering from the above diseases have been en eluded_ in the list but in chapters 
describing the general line of treatment of these diseases such th.erapies have been 
prescribed. Hence this mention here to clear the confusion of the physician and to 
prescribe them in case of their necessity.

In Jvara (fevers}, the similarity ·-of the ~tu (season ) and the do~as; 
in Prameha (diabetes) the similarity of the _du~yas (dhatus and malas) 
with the do~as; in Raktagulma (uterine tumors) the chronicity are the 
reasons for their easy curability (246-247). ' 
Notes:-Generally in all diseases, if the do$5S producing the disease and the do$a 
predominant during that particular season are one and the same, the diseases will 
be difficult to cure or even incurable. Fever is an exception to this rule, because 
the treatment is for only one Dosha; In all other diseases, if the do$aS producing the 
disease and the dii$y4 (dhatus and ma/as} affected are of similar qualities, diseases 
will be very difficult to cure. Diabetes is an exception to this rule because the same 
drugs and therapies will be suitable for both the do$4S and dii$yas. All diseases which

Honey, though tends to increase Vata is again useful in var~a :,:tu though 
Vata is predominant during that season. Likewise wines are best in 
diseases caused by alcoholic intoxication, and poison is best for remo-. . v1ng poison. 
Ghee of marshy places (prepared from the milk of animals of marshy

Though Jvara (fever) and Gulma (abdominal tumors) are both c~used 
by Kapha, though fas ting is the therapy for it (Kapha) and though the

Lords, wealthy persons and especially the kings, will usually have more 
number of foes than friends. Instigated by such enemies, persons who 
are close to the king, poison him through his food, drinks etc. Even 
,vomen do so, inspired by false belief of obtaining goodluck. So the 
king should appoint a Pni:Qacarya-protector of life (physician) who 
comes from a reputed family, who is affectionate, friendly, who has 
belief in god, is cultured . and having cultured kin, is efficient, polite 
with all, faithful (loyal), clean, obedient, not lazy, not sorrowful, not 
egoistic, not getting angry, not embarking upon adventure; intelligent 
to grasp the intention of speech, well versed in all the eight branches 
of Ayurveda, who possesses good knowledge of security of life, who • 
has with him efficacious recipes, (medicines) and who knows all the 
things accustomed to (by the king). He should be propitated with money

and honour, like a desciple worshipping his preceptor and a son his 
father: His advice shold be adhered to even though it is inconvenient 
(unpleasant). An elephant, though having a good pedigree is not prai­
sworthy, if it is not controlled by the hook ( of its driver). So the king 
should resort to the foods and other activities as prescribed by the 
physician. Though life has been bestowed by providence, it· needs to 
be protected in many ways. (2)

And also, the king will have a large retinue. Some diseases like pain 
in the abdomen, loss of conciousness etc., might kill the patient (persons) 
quickly. All patients especially, the king are to be carefully protected 
every minute, and at every stage. Because they (kings) are likely to 
indulge in risky activities; are i~capable of tolerating misery, by nature 
they are towards unhealthy activities or resort to them (willfully); by 
the appealing sweet words of those who are always nearby. So the king 
should arrange for the residence of physician very near to his palace, 
so as to facilitate him to keep watch directly overall the articles used 
by the king. ( 3) 
Notes:-Poisioning was one of the important methods of .killing enemies. this was 
very common among the kings and wealthy persons in ancient times. Poison was being 
administered through ~rticles ol food. drink., dress. cosmetics etc .. with the connivance 
of the persons who are very close to the kings. Hence. it was necessary to test all 
the materials . Afethods to detect poison had been developed and appropriate measures 
to treat diseases caused by poisons were planned. All these were the duties o{ the 
physician and so the kings always appointed an efficient physician to protect him from 
the danger of poisoning. Hence, the dire necessity of a royal p_hj,sician.

The physician should make the king take the food in his presence; 
Annaralf~a vidhi Adhyaya 
the food which has been properly prepared, tested by fire, shown to 
the peacock and sprinkled with water sanctified by holy chants; the hand 
of the king being adorned with potent herbs and precious stones. ( 4) 
Notes:-The food shol1 be accustomed, prepared well with different processes so 
as to be tasty. Putting the food into fire, showing it to the peacock are methods to 
test for any admixture of poison; sprinkling of holy water and wearing of herbs and 
gems are meant to remove other evil elf ects. The presence of the physician will help 
him to observe the likes and dislikes, the quantity and mode of eating o[ food by the 
king and advise him suitably. It will also assure the king that his food is good, wel{tested 
and safe and that immediate belp is available, ifany thing goes wrong. 
!~l.:tf'-4 ~ ~.:t•H(Sl~ffl-( ctld.'4~ llt...11 
The kettle drum which has been smeared with antitoxic recipes be 
beaten (sounded) at the time of the king, taking his food. (5) 
Notes:-Antipoisonous herbs were made into a thin paste, smeared over the leather 
tied to the kertle drum and allowed to dry. The drums µ.,ere being beaten very near 
to the dining room. The vibrations caused by the beating would then scatter the line 
powder of the herbs all around. This helped to drive awary flying insects and bacteria 
and also ward off bad smell from outside. The rythmic pleasant sound of the drum 
also helped in preventing other unpleasant sounds at the time of taking food.

Vi&ada (person who admiministered the poison) is afraid of ·being 
detected, appears miserable, f reightened, sweating, shivering; his 
mouth is dry and face dark; looks into that substance in which he has 
mixed poison. His upper garments often fall off, he hides himself behind 
pillars and walls. He is unsteady in his walk, becomes timid and shy, 
laughs at improper times, gives irrelevant answers even without questio­
ning or when questioned keeps silent; says that he has forgotten; makes 
sounds with his fingers, touches his neck often, scratches his head, licks 
his lips, yawns, scratches the ground, does all his actions in haste or 
in the wrong manner and does not remain in his own ( usual) place. ( 9)

Some-times, some weak minded persons and others who are guilty 
of different kinds of crime also exhibit the above feature, out of fear 
of royal command and out of urgency. So the food suspected to have 
been poisioned should be tested by fire and other methods. 
When poisoned food is thrown over the fire, it bnrns with single point 
flame (not with normal spreading flames), inturrupted, and slow; emits 
flame of different colours like· a rainbow and gives out cracking so~nd 
The smoke that emerges will be smelling like that of a dead body, causes 
fainting, watering of the eyes, nose and mouth; horripilations, headache,

The fire may react similarly when it comes contact with foods which 
are having more of oils and salts. So foods are to be tested 'Nith birds. 
After consuming poisoned foods, the crows lose their voice; flies do 
not sit on such foods and if by chance, they sit they die; the eyes of 
the cakora bird become red by the sight of poisoned foods; the voice 
of kokila (cuckoo) undergoes change; the gait of the swan·gets altered;

become excited (toxic), krikavaku (cock) hoots loudly, suka (green

Then, the person should be made to vomit immediately by administra­
tion of either fruits of madana or ala bu, bimbi, ko~atakI m~xed with 
curds and honey or the decoction of ni~pava. After vomitting, the patient 
should be given oleation therapy as well as the purgation therapy. Next, 
he should be given an antipoisonous recipe, consisting of triphala, trika(u 
na:gapu&pa, madhuka, barhiqa parqi, the two bi;hatis- all powdered a·nd 
mixed with the bile of any one of the animals such as lion, tiger, wolf, 
hyena, leapord, cat, jackal, deer, or lizard and also honey. This recipe 
known as Jrvana Agada is an excellent antidote for all kinds of poison. 
After the medicine gets digested the person shonld be given a yavagu 
(gruel) proces·sed with syama (gandhapriyaiigu) vyo&a, ativi&a mixed with 
milk and ghee. After the gruel also gets digested he can be given soft, 
boiled rice along with the soup of mudga prapared by processing it with 
trika(u, little of salt and ghee. His body should be annointed with the 
paste of madhuka, si~r~a and candana. ( 15)

stupor, disorders of sense perception, loss of strength, emaciation, 
pallor and enlarge~ent of the abdomen. 
In that condition the patient should be administered a purgative with 
fruits of nilini mixed with ghee and honey. He should next be given 
Dl1&ivi&ari (Agada) along with dad hi (curds). 
Notes:-Treatment of symptoms of inhalation smoke uf poisoned food described 
earlier was instilling of juice of plants like nalada, ku${ha etc., to the nose and eyes. 
The treatment for ailments arising from using a poisoned tooth brush will be described 
further on. Both are to be done for symptoms developing in the mouth. U-'hen poisoned 
food has been ingested it is very necessary to bring it out by administration of vamana 
(emetics) and vlrecana (purgatives). After thus removing the food, antipoisonous 
Annara/f$1f vidhi Adhyaya 
recipes are administered. Only then it will be effective. Durlvi$8ri Agada has been

If poison has been administered through the tooth-brush, the bristles of the 
tooth-brush fall out, it emits the smell of the poison and causes dryness and 
swelling of the palate, teeth, tongue and lips. In such a condition the parts of 
the mouth are to be scrapedGvith sharp instruments so as not to cause bleedin,© 
and then powder of the f oflowing drugs applied -flowers of dhataki, seeds 
of jambu and haritaki mixed with honey or with the paste of saptachada and 
honey. The mouth should be smeared with paste prepared .from the juices of 
da9ima, karamarda, bhavya, amrataka, kola and badara mixed with honey. The 
above treatments are applicable in cases where the poison is administered with

If poison is mixed with the oil used for oil bath, it will produce burning 
sensation on the skin, perspiration, ulcers, blebs and lacerations. The 
person is bathed in cold water and anointed with paste of candana, 
tagara, usira, ku~tha, vel}uupatrika (hingupatri), padma, kaleyaka (ra­

If poison is administered through the umbrella, there will be the 
appearance of boils on the body which are painful, suppurating quickly 
and resembling the ripe fruit of jambava. For this condtion, a warm 
application of the paste of madhuka, patala, kaseruka, lodhra, anjana,

The physician should carefully scrutinise (inspect) the washing of 
fruits, roots, leaves, water for washing and other articles (such as 
vessels, plates, spoons etc.) used for preparing the food; examine by 
smelling those which can be smelt, touching those which can be examined 
by touch, sprinkle poison detectors over them, and reexamine them after 
a period of one nacjika ( 24 minutes). Having confirmed the purity of 
the vessels, water and oth~r materials he should arrange for cooking

Weak poisons become further weakened quickly in the presence ( or 
nearness) of powerful poisons. So the wise physician should wear a 
powerful poison ( on his body). Such wearing of a poison brings good 
luck, destroys rak~asas ( evils or harmful creatures) and helps earn 
affection from others. (24-24 1 /2)

The Physician, while attending to the protection of the person and

king and fight against his enemies, .by staying in a tent which has a flag 
flying high, equipped with medicines, instruments and appliances. ( 3 3) 
Notes:- The physician was an important member of the kings,s army. He remained 
very near to the king,s aprartments, and served all those who needed his help irrespective 
of the rank of the person in the army. His work involved administration of medicines, 
surgical operations, examination of water, food etc., used by the army for detection 
of poison and adoption of suitable remedial measures. He was being accomodated

The waters of the reservoirs (ponds, lakes, rivers) which has been 
poisoned, will have bad taste, slight warmth, full of long streaks (lines) 
and foam, heavy (hard to digest) and broken up (curdled); rejected by 
the birds and shoals of dead dish floating. It produces pain, swelling 
and irritation on touch. Rice cooked in. that water causes burning

time, causing burning sensation, producing fainting and fever after 
digestion and appearance of colours like blue, yellow, brown or red

In the bright half of the month, on an auspicious day when stars like 
Pu~ya, Punarvasu, Hasta, Chitra, M~gasira, SravaQa, Revati, Satabhi~ak, 
Prajapati, Uttara and others from a Yoga (union) with the lord of O~dhrs 
(Soma or moon), at such an auspicious time, the person (physician) 
should go to the river Siiidhu, and collect from the river bed, the smooth, 
shining, blue coloured stones of aiijana (sauvrralijana) having good 
smell, colour and· brilliancy. To it, is added one-eighth of its weight 
of equal quantities of gold, silver and copper. This mass is kept in a 
cruicible which is placed on the fire, after worshipping the fire with 
offering and prayers. The fire is then kindled with the wood of khadira, 
kadara, dhava, syandana and such others or with heaps of cowdung. 
Arya Avalokitesvara, Arya Tara, Brahma, Dak~a, Asvinis, Rudra, Indra, 
Adityas, Soma, VaruQa, Vaisvanara, Vata, Vi~l)u, Janaka, Bharadvaja, 
Annara/f$4 vidhi Adhyaya 
Dhaiivaiitari, Susruta, Bhavya, Sukanya, Skatida, Cyavana, Vainateya 
and such other gods and divinities are worshipped in the prescribed 
manner, with offerings of auspicious ak~ata (coloured rice), Hija (fried 
paddy); drawing the sign of swastika on the floor, and offering payasa 
(milk pudding) prepared from de husked barley, jaggery and ghee; next, 
eld~rly physicians and brahmaQ.as who have put on white cloths are also 
worshipped, and presented with large amount of money. 
The combination of Anjana and metals, which has by this time become 
liquid is stirred and poured into separeate vessels containing solution 
of cowdung, cows urine, ghee, curds, honey, muscle-fat, bone-marrow, 
oil, wine, solution of different kinds of fragrant substances, solution 
of sugar and juice of sugarcane; decoction of harrtaki, amalaka, vibhita­
ka, ka~marya, m~dvika, si;tigataka, kaseruka, utpala, nalin.a, saugafidhika 
and mi;Qalaka; soup of meat of lava (bursted quail) kapiii.jala (black 
partridge) eIJ.a (fawn, deer) sasa and also in the decoction of madhuka 
· caiidana, kalanusari, nalada, padmaka, usira, manji~ta, ananta, gairika 
and kurfikuma (kesara) in order of succession separately. It is then tied 
in a white cloth and kept immersed in rain water for twelve days. Next 
it is dried in shade and mixed with sphatika, mukta, pravala, and 
kalanusari (saileya). The gods are worshipped again ~ith prayers and 
offerings and a maiden (virgin) who has put on a dress which is not 
torn, is asked to grind the above mixture (into a nice powder) and fill 
it into a· special container of collyrium made of gold, silver, copper, 
conch, ~tone, teeth of ruminating animals, horns of bison, vaiqurya 
stone,' sphatika(rock crystal) 1ne~asi;figi, pith of asana and any such 
material. 
The gods are again worshipped, as before; the learned brahmaIJ.as 
should then consecrete it specially with chants of Savitri (sun). The 
container is then mounted on an elephant which is adorned with flowers 
and taken in procession from the physicians house to the palace of the 
king, accompanied by white coloured umbrelas, whiskers, fans, sounds 
of conch and drums ete, preceded by reputed brahmaIJ.as chanting Vedic 
hymn and auspicious prayers. After establishing the eye-salve container 
AS24 185 

Chapter8 
in the palace at a convenient place, the physician shall begin to use this 
'Sarva:rthasiddhi Anjana' (collyrium bringing success in all respects) as 
prescribed by the king of Videha. The eye salve may be applied with 
the help of a rod prepared from any one of the materials suggested 
for preparing the container. Before applying, the physician should take 
bath and become clean, worship cows and bra:hmal'}.as, observe vows, 
chant the following Dharil'}.i (sacred hymn) and apply the salve to the 
right eye first and next to the other eye. 
''I pray unto the Lord who protects the eyes, to the Tathagata, Arhata 
and Samyak Sambuddha; Om, purify the (seeing) eye, the eye, the eye 
of wisdom, the eye of knowledge, the eye of supreme knowledge;'' 
I pray repeating the above hymn;-the collyrium should be put into both 
the eyes, every day, both in the morning and evening. It is very sacred, 
promotes health, vigour, destroys all kinds of pois•ons,; it was formulated 
long back by the Asvinis for the sake of Indra, to kill the demon Vttra; 
it is thus suitable to the kings, nobles, and those who visfi to conquer 
the land; to the brahmal'}.as who are eager to master the Vedas or other 
difficult sciences and those who have a controlled and pleasant 
mind.( 59-61)

Anya yoga (some other antipoisonous recipes·): . 
Further on will be described some beneficient receipes formulated 
by Bi;haspathi, by the use of which the king cannot be killed by the 
enemies. 
A decoction of bilva, aQhaki ( tuvari), yavak~ara, patali, balhika, Q~ana 
(marica), sriparIJ.i (ka~marya) and sallakr. 
This decoction .sprinked over poisoned materials· such as fodder, 
firewood, drinking water, weapons, cots and furniture, reservoirs of 
water, armour, ornaments, umbrella, whisks, fans, dwelling appa­
rtments and others, make them poison-free. 
I 
I Selu, patala, ativi~a, sigru, gopi (sariva), punarmava, samaiiga (manjista). vi;~amiila twak (bark of roots of vasa) kapittha, v~~a, soIJ.itam 
(raktacandan~) and daiitasata all made into a decoction will act likewise, 
on sprinkling. 
Lak&a, priyangu, manji~ta, sarnanga, harenuka, ya~ti and honey are 
all made into a nice paste with the bile of mangoose, and filled into 
the hollow of a cow's horn, sealed well and buried under the ground 
for seven days. It is taken out later, filled into a fillet of gold and tied 
to the hand as an amulet. Any poisoned materiai touched by that hand 
Chapter8 
immediately becomes poison-free. 
Manohv4, 4la, flowers and bark of sami, nisa, svetasar~apa,kapittha, 
ku~ta are all made into a fine paste-with the bile of a do_g or a brown 
coloured cow, acts in the same way as the above when worn as' an amulet. 
This recipe konwn as Saumya Agada is a very efficient antipoisonous 
recipe. 
The amulet of the plant m11&ika (an antipoisonous herb) or ajaruha 
tied to the hand removes the poison.( 62-71)

food. By this, the poison which has been ingested. will become digested. 
It does not produce any harm even though no poison is present inside. 
Jatu (silajatu) sarjarasa, usira, sar~apa, patra, valaka, vella, aru~kara, 
pura and flowers of arjuna, all mixed together and used so as toproduce 
smoke inside the places of dweling, removes the poison of both the 
vegetable kingdom and the animal kingdom. In such a house where this 
smoke is present, poisonous insects, rats and reptiles will not survive 
and acts of witchcraft sorcery will also become nullified.(74- 78)

The smoke of plumes of the peacock, bones of the balaka bird (crane)

Powder of haridra, mafiji~(a, kil)ihi, kal)a and nimba applied to the 
body makes it poison-free, thus said Gautama. 
Annara}f1a vidhi Adhyaya 
For a person who has partaken poisoned food, the antidote known 
as Sanjivinr agada should be administered in the for~ of nasal medica­
tion, drink, eye-salve, and anointing for the body; powerful emetics 
should be administered along with pippali, madhuka, honey, sugar, and 
sugar-cane juice; the two ni~as, patra, vella, and trivi:t all made into 
a powder and used with honey will be a good purgative. If letting out 
the blood is needed, venesection should be done. 
The procedure of hi:dayavaral).a (protecting the heart) should be done 
first for the king who is in the midst of enemies. He should drink the 
ghee known as Ajeya gh~ita or Arni:ta ghi:ita ( described in ch pater 40 
of uttara tantra) before taking food. 
Ghee, honey,. curds, milk and cold water should be used in that order. 
Meat of lizards, antelope and mungoose can be used mixed with sugar, 
madhuka, and paste of palindi; the meat of pi:~sata (spotted deer) with 
kal}a and sunthi; that of the peacock with nagara, ativi~a and sitopala 
(sugar candy). 
For persons who have been given poisoned drinks, me.at soup mixed 
with ghee and cooled can be given. 
Persons who have been administered poison, should be given purifica­
tory therapy both of the upper parts and lower parts of the body. After 
such purification, fine powder of copper mixed with honey should be 
given, at the proper time, to purify the heart; after purifying the heart 
in this way, the person should be given one saIJ.a (about 3 grams) of 
fine powder of gold to lick. Poison does not adhere to the parts of the 
body of the person who has licked gold, just as water does not adhere 
to the leaf of the lotus plant. His duration of life also gets enhanced 
greatly. 
Even for gara (artificial poisons, homicidal poisoning) the same 
treatment holds good. 
By these methods the physician should protect the king from homicidal 
poisoning, beacuse the death of the king leads to cessation of all the 
Chapter8 
activities of the people also. ( 8 5b-95)

The kings, by virtue of their soverignity, ( commanding) bravery, f orgi­
veness and sacrifice, sometimes become superhuman though born as 
Annaralffll vidhi Adh.,vaya 
human. So the kings should be served with greatest care and caution. 
The physician should announce his coming before actually going to 
the presence of the king; he should not sit on a seat which is improper 
even though approved but should remain standing, should not interfere 
in the middle while the king speaks, take sufficient time to explain to 
the king anything beneficial to him but take very little time to say anything 
of himself, that too in the presence of the loved and good persons, at 
appropriate place and time; he shou.ld speak only that which is agreeable 
to the ethical discipline; should not instruct the king unless asked for; 
otherwise it becomes an adventure (risk). 
The king should not be served with bad conduct, as such conduct would 
lead to total destruction. The speech should be comforting to him and 
unpleasant words should be avoided. 
Words which are generous and comforting are to be used and mistakes 
of speech avoided. If the king's speech is contradictory, the phy~1cian 
should remain silent and thus avoid unpleasantness and argument. 
Pe'rsons, who have not understood the mind of the king, though 
schol~rs, and the liked, do not earn the affection of the king whereas 
others ( who have, understood the mind of the king), will earn his affection 
even though they are children and the disliked. 
Any work however minor, should be undertaken only after obtaining 
due permission; the physician should not.visit places such as the treasury . 
and harem ( without permission) aild should not remain there too long 
(having gone there on request). 
He (the physician) should express satisfaction even for small gifts, 
should not show his indignation with others; neither reveal the affairs 
of the (kings) household to others nor indulge in spreading rumours. 
He should not imitate the king either in dress or any other act; should 
wear the dress p'resented by the king only for pleasing him. 
He should onl): smile when the king laughs loudly, that too after him. 
When the.king is speaking out the secrets of others, he (physician) should 
AS25 193 

CJ1apter 8 
remain silent and when he speaks out the secrects of him ( the physician) 
he (the physician) should remain deaf, courageous, pleasing and calm. 
He should not spend large amount of money with great effort (on 
any pretext) because any such spending always leads to one's fall and 
misery and not to one's prosperity or happiness. (97-107)

Those who partcipate with the king in sports, in the use of weapons, 
in handling snakes ( or other wild animals) and fire should do so sporti­
vely, with tact, skill and humility and restrain the king (without injuring 
him in any way). 
Having obtained improper wealth or honour from the king, he ( the 
physician) should not exhibit it too much nor behave in such a manner 
that a gift is everlasting. 
The king should sleep on the bed at nights only after it is made safe 
by protective spells, auspicious grains and ash sanctified by sacred 
hymns. 
I The image of the goddess (Sakti) should be kept near the head of 
the cot, a pot filled with sacred water adorned with flower should be 
worshipped in the evenings, just after food and at the time of going 
to bed. This kind of worship should be done by the king who is clean 
Annara/f$1I vidhi Adhyaya 
and helped by the physician who is also clean. This svastyayana (benova­
lent ritual) confers long life, prosperity and destroys evil-spirit, poison 
and other bad effects of sin. ( 112-113)

So far, the methods of counteracting poisons were described in brief 
and more if it, will be said later in the Uttara sthana; knowing all these 
the physician should adopt apt measures recognising the abnormal 
symptoms by his intellegence and skill. ( 114)

The king who understands and follows the instruction regarding 
protection from natural poisons and artificial (homicidal) poisons, daily, 
without neglegence, becomes invincible from enemies, within his own 
kingdom and outside -attains the status of a benefactor (noble soul) 
always caring for the welfare of the people at large. ( 115) 
'{fir ~s,-;qp.r: 
Thus ends the eighth chapter. 
Notes:- In this chapter the different methods adopted by enemies to kill the king 
and nobles by poisoning them and remedial measures to get over that are described. 
The practice of homicidal poisoning was very common in ancient times, chiet1y among 
the rich people, though even ordinary men were not exempt form this bad practice. 
Most of' the times the poison was a synthetic product prepared by mixing plants, plant 
products, products which were considered as poisonous. From the symptoms of 
poisoning mentioned in this chapter, we are Jed to presume that in most of the cases 
there was no instantneous death and so the poisons were not very toxic but produced 
certain diseases. The techniques adopted to detoxicate the poisoned materials and 
methods of treatment ol the symptoms of poisoning were the best known at that time. 
Removal of poison from the body quickly by inducing vomittings, purgations, Jetting 
out the blood. administration of known antidotes are the treatments of poisoning even 
now. Difference is only in the drugs and better techniques.

One should not think that the risk of poisoning was a thing of the past and the present 
day is free form it. Even with great progress in civilisation and way of life, man has 
not been able to cast off some of his vices such hatredness, craze for superiority, 
supermacy and so on. Rivalry between one nation and the other, still con(inues to 
exist. The progress in the different fields of science is being utilised more for destructive 
purposes than constructive. The rapid increase in the production of lethal weapons 
of nuclear energy by wealthy nations holds ouJ a great threat of destruction for the 
entire world~ The hazards of radiation already experienced makes people shiver in 
their spines. The present day battles become a universal phenomena though at the 
commencement it might be between two countries. Invention of weapons of mass 
destruction has rapidly replaced the old method of direct combat in the battle field. 
Poisoning of air with poisonous gases and harmful bacteri~ which produce many 
diseases, contamination of water by deadly chemicals -known as the,gas war, bacterial 
war, chemical war etc., are being en visaged. The increasing stock piling of all these 
hazardous weapons of masJ destruction, has been pushing the present civilisation to 
the brink of its extinction. 
Even in his daijy life, modern man is runnin_g this risk. Industrialisation in the present 
century has given rise to many kinds of health hazards. The atmosphere is being polluted 
by harmful smoke, fumes and dust, emanating from factories. The waste water and 
other effluents are being allowed into rivers and other reservoirs of water making the 
water unsafe for men and animals. Some of the chemical issed as pesticides are proving 
dangerous to man and animals. Even some chemical and these are detectable in the 
grains, fruits, vegetables etc., which are in. daily use; use of powerful acids, alkalies, 
flames, laser and other kinds of rays, are all hazardous to human health. 
Needless to say, that unscrupulous and malevalent men exist in the society always. 
Such people by their mad desire to become rich quickly and easily pollute many things 
of daily consumption by adding undesirable things to them. Adulteration of articles 
of food such as sugar,. butter, milk, oil, ghee and what not-is on the increase day after 
day. This activity has even entered the field of medicine and we find many life saving 
drugs being spurious; many of them produce diseases instead ofcuriog them. 
So the hazard of pollution and consequent poisoning is as great even now as in the 
past or even more. When such is the hinderance .to health, all care and caution has 
to be taken maintain it normally. There is thus, on urgent need to avoid polluting all 
things, and to adopt and adhere rigidly to a code of right conduct by one and all, in 
view of theh,pwn good health.

The meat of animals living in villages (domestic), marshy places 
and in water, should not be eaten along with honey, jaggery, sesamum, 
milk, blackgram, raddish, bisa (lotus stalk) and germinated grains; 
especially milk along with fish; both are sweet in taste, are sweet 
at the end of digestion, both are abhi~yandi ( cause obstruction of 
tissues) and mutually incompatable because of their cold and hot 
potency respectively; especially the cilicima, which is very scaly, has 
red coloured eyes, red stripes all over the body, red complextion, 
and lives generally very near to the ground. This is a very powerful 
abhi~yandi, produces many diseases and Arna visa ( endogenous toxins) 
quickly.(2)

All sour things mixed with milk become incompatable. Similarly, also 
the fruits and grains like kangu, varaka, maku~taka, vella, kulattha, ma~a 
and ni~pava. 
Milk should not be used immediately after eating mt1laka and other 
leafy vegetables, because of the fear (risk) of getting leprosy; the leaves 
of pau~kara, rohiQ.fka and jatuka should not be eaten along with honey 
and mi~k; like wise the meat of the peigor..s which has been fried in 
oil of sar~apa. The fish and fruit of badara fried in mustard oil and unfricd 
badara fruits should not be used together; similarly the meat of svavid 
(porcupine) and the varaha (wild boar); uncooked (or incompletely 
cooked along with Pitta (bile of animals). Meat of the kukku~a (Cot.~ 
and pi;~ata (spotted deer) along with dadhi (curds); the meat of ram 
with the leaves of kusumbha; sa~kuli (fried pastry/ eatable) prepared 
from sesamum with the sauvfraka ( sour gruel). 
Milk and salt, soup of black gram and raddish, leafly vegetables with 
butter; upodaka with maireya and mardvfka (fermented liquiors); prlu 
with karrra, bisa with germinated grains; the fruits of lakiica along ,vith 
curds, soup of black gram, jaggery, honey or ghee; kadali phala with 
curds, buttermilk or fruits of Uila phala; kakamaci along with pippalr 
marica, honey or jaggery, the same (kakamacf) which has been cooked 
in the vessel used for cooking fish or ginger or cooked in any other 
vessel but kept overnight; the ghee which has been kept for more than 
ten days in a bronze vessel; and use of wines, curds, honey and bhallataka 
made hot-all these are incompatables. ( 3)

Honey, ghee, muscle-fat, taila (sesamum oil) and water mixed in equal 
quantities, in the combination of two, three or all of them are incompita­

I rain water taken as an after-drink; honey and seeds of pu~kara. Sarkara 
(wine prepared with sugar) and maireya (wine prepared from dates) . 
and honey used together are incompatables and cause'profound increase 
of Vata. 
Haridraka (a kind of tuber used as vegetable) fried in mustard oil is 
incompitable and cause profound increase of Pitta; payasa (milk pu­
dding) followed by maiitha (solution of flour and sugar) is incompatable 
and causes profound increase of Kapha. 
Upodaka processed with paste of tila (sesamum) is the cause for 
diarrhoea; meat of balaka (crane) with varuIJ.i (a kind of liquor) and 
kulma~a (steam-cqoked grams) is incompatable; the same (meat of 
balaka) fried in muscle-fat of the varaha (boar) causes sudden death. 
Meat of godha, lava, tittiri,_ mayura, and kapiiijala cooked in castor 
oil using the castor plant as fuel is incompatable; likewise the meat of 
harita bird held in a stick ha'ridra (probably daruharidra) or the same 
(meat of harita bird) cooked inside 'hot ash and sand arid mixed with 
honey (is incompatable). 
Cbapter9 
Pippali processed (fried) in the oil used for frying fish (is incompata­

Food materials which are of cold and hot potency, which are freshly 
harvested or very old, which are uncooked (unripe) and cooked (ripe) 
should not be combined together and used. (5)

immersing oneself in cold water soon after prolonged exposure to 
sunlight is the cause for diseases of the skin and eyes (vision) and 
increase of thirst also. Likewise the drinking of milk (soon after long 
exposure to sunlight) in causing raktapitta (haemorrhagic diseases). 
Taking food immediately after physicar fatigue is the cause for either 
vomitting or abdominal tumour; food taken immediately after getting 
tired by speaking for long perods causes hoarseness of voice. 
Thus, incompatability (unsuitable for health) regarding articles of 
food, drinks which are in common use were described. As regards the 
drugs, their .use should be in the same manner as described. Their 
incompatability (wrong usage) are not described here for the fear of 
abuse (by unqualified / unscrupulous persons); such a mention here 
is not good. ( 6)

Those substances, which cause the increase of do~as in the body but 
do not ~xpell them out (of the body) are known as Viruddha, and so 
they remain antogonistic to the dhatus "(tissues).

The use of incompatable foods will produce boils, swelling, toxicity,

the eight Mahagadas ( dreaded diseases) and even death just like poi­

In such diseases, purificatory therapies should be adopted quickly or 
in persons who are unfit for it, palliative measures should be done by 
the use of substances which have the qualities opposite of these used 
earlier; or even of those which are of similar properties, keeping in 
mind the condition of the body. 
Incompatable foods etc. do not cause harm to persons who are 
accustomed to physical exercise and oleation therapy daily, who have 
powerful digestive capacity, who are of middle age and strong. Similarly, 
foods which have become accustomed and which are in small quantity 
do not cause trouble even though such food are incompatable. They 
even cure the diseases of patients by causing variations in the do~as 
etc.; as for example- the use of dadhi(curds) and milk etc together in 
different combinations ( with other r~,aterials) does not become inc om pa­
table always. ( 14)

By different combinations, even healthy foods became unhealthy;

Bad foods which have become accustomed to the body should be 
discontinued gradually in the proportion of a quarter (one-fourth of the 
accustomed quantity) and good foods should be taken instead, slowly 
increasing by one, two and three periods of taking food. ( 16)

By this method, the do~as get rid of the bad effects, acquire their 
normal qualities, cease to produce diseases and attain their own stability 
(congeneal for health). ( 17) 
Notes :-Discontinuance of bad foods {and even bad activities) should be gradual 
and reducin in quantity an not sudden. Sudden discontinuance will cause harm to the 
body because it will have developed a certain adjustments with the accustomed 
substances and cannot be without it. It requires sufficient time to be without it and 
to adjust to new substances. Good things which are not accu_stomed to the body, may 
evoke difficulties in the begining and it is only after sufficient time the body becomes 
accustomed to it. So both discontinuance of bad foods and continuance ofgood foods, 
should be gradual and slow.

Sleeping at day time is beneficial during grf~ma (summer) because, 
in this season Vata will have undergone caya (mild increase), dryness 
is more and nights are short, because it is adana kala. Whereas in other 
seasons it (day-sleep) causes increase of Kapha and Pitta. (26)

are the causes for loss of sleep. ( 34-36) 
Notes:-Satvagul}a stands for illumination, intellegence, purity of thought, alertness 
and other mental funcions in a healthy manner. Its increase makes the mind to get 
engaged in reading, writting, contemplating, reasoning etc., on useful and interesting 
subjects. At such occassions persons will not get sleep. Tamogu[Ja is its opposite and 
stands for ignorance, incativity, and diminished mental functions. Victory over it is, 
Viruddhanna vijfutiya Adhyaya 
in other words, increase of Satvagul}a, by artificial methods. It can also be interpreted 
as victory over darkness, in other words the presence of bright light.

If one keeps awake at night due to unaccustomed condtions, he should 
compensate it by sleeping the next morning, for half of that period 
( duration of loss of sleep) without taking any food. ( 41) 
Persons who get insufficient sleep should use milk, sugercane juice, 
meat soup and meat of animals of marshy places and of those living 
in water; eatables prepared from jaggery and flour; rice, wines, bla­
ckgram, skimmed buttermilk, curds of buffalo's milk; resort to applying 
oil to the body, massage, bath, putting oil on the head, ears and eyes, 
application of lubricating paste to the head and face; the bed should 
be spread in a place with mild breeze and pleasant smell; mild and 
comfortable massaging oj,.the body by those who are affectionate and 
dependant on him; use of ghee followed by drinking of milk boiled with 
Jrvanrya (rejuvinating) group of drugs; warm embrace by the tender arms 
of the wife; a sense of satisfaction of having done good deeds, thinking 
of things pleasant to the mind and fulfilment of desire-all these are going 
to bestow happy sleep. ( 41-45)

meeting place off our roads, gardens, burial ground, slaughter house, 
reservoirs of \vater and herbs, house of the twice born (brahma}J.as) 
teachers. gods and kings, should be avoided. Time, such as day, at the 
Chapter 9 
time of letting the cattle out for grazing (morning), midday, midnight 
and on inauspicious days, should be avoided; so also the also organs 
other than the genitals (mouth, axilla, groin, anus etc.), when he is thirsty 
and when not interestly prepared (when not desirous). 
Man should not make the woman play his role (allowing her to mount 
on him); should avoid especially the woman who is desirous of excessive 
copulation, who is pregnant, who has just delevered, who is menstruating 
and who has a narrow (constricted)' vaginal passage. 
He should avoid hitting the head ( of his partner during the ecstacy 
of libido). He should not withhold the ejaculation ( discharge of semen) 
in the middle. Copulation should be restricted to one's capacity of mind 
and body (without causing fatigue of either of them). Man should not 
be engrossed in it too much. ( 4"1)

An adult who is (keenly) interested in copulation should engage himself 
in it with a pleasant mind, with the woman whom he likes, in secrecy, 
adopting the suitable posture, anointed with good smelling cosmetics, 
free from the urges of urine etc., not without taking food (i.e. after 
meals) not taki1,1.g too much food, having gained strength by use of 
aphrodisiacs (foods or drugs) for three days earlier, and with the woman 
who has all the womanly qualities. 
Copulation may be indulged into once in two days during vasanta 
Viruddhanna vij'Yiiiya Adhyaya 
(spring); once in a fortnight in the next (gri~ma-summer) and also in 
ghanodaya (var~a rainy season); and a strong man may indulge in it as 
I many times as he desires during hemanta and Sisira ( cold season). 
Man getting tired after sexual intercourse, should take bath, put on 
cosmetics, comfort himself with fan and moonlight, partake meat, wine, 
milk, soup, rasila (sweetened syrup of plantains) and other eatables 
prepared with sugar in plenty, cold water and then go to sleep. (.s-c-S~

boys (less than sixteen years) will not have attained full development

dries up quickly like the little quantity of water in a tank; if old man

Semen, is the most valuable essence of the body, more valuable than 
even the essence of food; it has to be carefully protected (preserved) 
by the self controlled person. The body, thus protected by semen and 
carefully preserved, bestows excellent progeny. 
While indulging in all things (food, sex etc.) which give quick pleasure, 
one should be self-controlled, he should also keep in mind the good 
result he anticipates and become contented. These will be enough to 
obtain happiness. ( 61-,2)

Notes: Man's activities are mainly three (a) physical (b) mental and (c) vocal. For 
these, some rules of right conduct have been prescribed for one's own good. Adhering 
to them will bestow health and happiness. Whereas voilating them either willfully or 
by ignorance will lead to ill-health and misery. Similarly proper use oFsense organs 
to understand the things outside will lead to maintenance of health whereas their 
improper use willproduce diseases. Likewise the changes in the atmosphere in different 
seasons also bring about change inside the body. If such changes are very abnormal 
they cause many diseases in the body, unless precautionary measures are taken.

The do&as do not produce disorders quickly in those who indulge in 
unhealthy things (foods, activities etc.), as long as, there is hinderance

Notes : Foods and activities bring about the increase of one or more of the do$4S 
when their qualities are similar. The increased do$4S in their turn, bring about abnormali­
ties in the dti$y4s (tissues and body wastes). If the qualities of the d0$y4s are opposite 
to the qualities of the the do$4S, there will be hinderance to the increase of the d0$4S. 
On such occassions the do$4S do not produce diseases quickly because they will not 
have undergone the increase needed to cause disease.

All the do~as are not of equal strength and all the bodies (of persons) 
do not possess .the same degree of resistance to disease. 
All the unhealthy things are also not equally capable of producing 
diseases; they become utmost unhealthy when they combine with do~as 
having similar qualities. (61,-.t,;) 
Notes :-Compared among themselves v8ta is very powerful, next Jess is Pitta and 
still Jess is Kapha. For them to undergo increase and produce diseases, even one mild 
cause is enough for v8ta, one or more causes of moderate strength may be required 
for Pitta and one or more powerful causes are needed for Kapha. Ressistence to diseases 
is of three kinds (a) natural or inherent and (b) artificial or newly created (c) seasonal. 
Of these it is the first which is permanent and so is important. The degree of natural 
resistance varies in respect of heredity, race, habitat, age, sex, co11stitution and so 
on. It is at its best in adults, males, and in those constitutions formed out of combination 
of all the three do$8S in equal proportions (samm#ra Prakriti). The degree of natural 
resistance has a large number of variations. Because of this only, it is seen that all 
persons indulging in same type of unhealthy foods etc., living in the same region do 
notget affected simultaneously during an epidimic. 
The nature of unhealthy things are also very different. Some of them are very mild 
and not capable of increasing the do$8S, some are moderate and some are powefful 
to cause the increase; some times only one cause is enough and some other times more 
than one cause should combine together to increase the do$8S. The qualities of the 
unhealthy foods etc., will cause the increase of thatpaiticular do$a which is the same 
as their own but not of the do$a which has different or opposite qualities.

The do~as which have undergone increase by the effect of many 
causes, combining in their opposites, in persons who are strong, will 
produce diseases which continue in the body for a long period of 
time. ( 69) 
Notes:-The combination of many causes will no doubt be_ very powerful to cause 
increase of the do$AS and produce diseases. But each of" the do$8S has different qualities, 
sometimes the do$8S of opposite qualities, may get increased at ,th_e same 'fi,me by the 
same causes and combine together inside the body. Such a combination is called the 
Viruddhanna vijiwya Adhyaya 
combination of the opposites. In that combination any one do$a becomes more powerful 
than the other and produce the disease. If such a condition takes place in persons who 
are strong (physical strength and also good natural resistance to diseases) it can only 
produce a disease of moderate severity, persisting in the body for the Jong time but 
not a severe disease causing death quickly.

If all the three do~as undergo increase in equal degree, even with trivial 
causes, in bodies (persons) which have been indulging in unhealthy foods 
etc., they (do~as) produce fatal diseases quickly, invading the seats of 
life and all the pathways (of diseases) pen.etratining deep into them. (6q) 
Notes:-In~rease of all the three do$8S together at the same time and their combination 
inside the body will be powerful. They spread all over the body quickly, affect the 
important organs like the heart, head and other vital organs (whose working supports 
life) and produce powerful diseases causing quick death. Diseases which are caused 
by any one do$a are mild and easily curable, those caused by any two do$4S are moderate 
and curable with difficulty, and those caused by all the three do$8S together are severe 
and incurable.

In some persons even indulgence in unhealthy foods etc., do not cause 
increase of the do~as, because their body will have become accu.stomed 
to them by long use. The increase of ~o~as even if happens, will get 
decresed by the usual daily physical activities, breeze and sunlight. ('70) 
Notes:-Bad foods and things, even of poisonous nature though continued to be used 
for a Jong time do not produce any sudden increase of the doflfs because the body 
will have become accustomed to them, and some kind of a conditioned equillibrium 
will have become established inside the body. Such persons will not sulf er from diseases 
due to those accustomed things.

Persons whose food, age, habits and constitutions are all different, 
get affected by one and the same disease, which is caused by abnormali­
ties of air etc. when they are exposed to it. Such abnormalities of air 
etc., are due to abnormal movement of planets, calamities which occur. 
naturally in the earth, atmosphere and the sky. The cause for such natural 
abnormalities of air etc., is the (sinful) acts of the community. ( ?0~2)

epidemic disease breaks out in a region, it affects a large number of persons in the 
community are not similar in all respects. Such diseases are very poserful, their mode 
of spread very quick and their source common. Hence, their aff1iction to many, very 
quickly. AncieJJts had recognised that such epidemics are due to use of contaminated 
air, water, land and season; which are common to all in a community~ They attributed 
such a contamination to superhuman forces (planets, comets, meteors, etc.) natural1 
calamities (earth-quakes, typhoons, volcanoes, forest fires etc.,) which. are in turn 
due to Adharma (unrightous acts) of the community as a whole.

In the case of season having unusual features, such of the regimen 
prescribed for seasons commencing with Heman ta should be followed 
even though out of seasqn. Otherwise there is the risk of being affected 
by the features of both cold and heat. The regimen prescribed for seasons 
of cold, heat and rain are also to be similarly planned. So, in the matter 
I of following of the regimen, both Heman ta and Sisira are the same. (81-82) , 
Notes:-Meaning of the above verses can be made clearer as follows. Three kinds 
of climatic changes may take place unusually at certain periods. Viz., (a) atiyoga -
increase of the normal features than t*e usual (b) a yoga -decrease of the normal features 
than the usual and (c) mithyayoga -appearance of features not usual for that season 
(features of any other season showing up). All these three are abnormal. Doubt naturally 
arises as to how the seasonal regimen has to be followed. Hence, it is clarified that 
in case of increase of the usual features in the season, the regimen piescribed for 
that season itself should be followed more intensively, in case of decrease of the usual 
feature it is enough to follow the same regimen mildly; and in case of appearance 
of unusual features, it is necessary to follow the regimen of the invading season. For 
example, if the features of sisira .rtu appears in gri$ma rtu, the regimen should be that 
of sisira rtu though it is actually grf$ma.

Actions pertaining to the past lives are known as Daiva; whereas 
actions pertaining to the present life are known are Pauru~a. These two 
are again of three kinds; the good, moderate and bad. 
The goQd actions of both the past lives and present life together help 
the maintainance of very happy life to the stipulated full period9 the 
bad actions of both, together, make for life of opposite nature (miserable 
and short), the moderate kind of action make for medium kind of life, 
mixture of good and bad actions of both make for a mixed kind of 
life.( 84-8S") 
Notes:-One of the important doctrines of Hindu philosophy is the belief in past, 
present and future Jives for every living being. The actions o[ every life is not going 
to end with that life alone. Good actions g1ve good effects, bad ones produce bad 
effects and both mixed will give mixed effect. In the language of Indian phylosophy 
the {karma) actions of past life are known as Adri$fa (unseen) Daiva {providential, 
divine) Purakrta (done previously) and prarabdha {obtained from the past). The effects 
o[ these past.actions are known as Vasana {covering, adherents) as these adhere to

and Akala (unnatural, premature). Hence, the good or bad for life are 
described here (in Ayurveda). (Sq) 
Notes:-Indu, the commentator states that Ak§lamrtu or untimely death is due to 
actions which ripen whithout any fixed period of time and K§lamrftyu -timely death 
-is due to actions which ripen after a certain determined period. It is only aRer ripening, 
the actions produce their effect. The time required for ripening being varible, certain 
things can be done during this period to alter the effects, though the effects cannot 
be fully removed. Certain good things are to be adopted and certain bad things 
discontinued; such good things are called as hita {suitable) and bad things as ahita 
{unsuitable) to life. Both are described in Ayurveda.

The followers of Vedas say, that "death is of one hundred and one 
kind; of them, one is the Kala (timely, natural) and the remaining hundred 
are Agan tu ( external, coming from outside, unnatural). They suggest 
, I -Atmavadha (suicide) by performance of Syena yaga (3: kind of sacrifice), 
waging war against enemies and engaging in prolonged sacrifies like 
Soma yaga, etc. 
Those desiring a long life may gain it by performing sacrifices such 
as _Mitravinda. Life, is thus to pe protected by such activities always. 
( ")O-G}2.) 
Notes:-In ancient times of India, persons who have become very old, used to invite 
death by performance of certain sacrifices, by engaging themselves in battles etc., 
Viruddhanna viJ>w'ya Adhyaya 
some others tried to protect their life from untimely death by performing different 
kind of sacrifices etc.

Saugatas (Buddhists) asse_rt that death is of four kinds. Indulgence 
in bad things which are to be avoided by those persons whose life span 
is· pre-determined is certain to make them sick and in those whose life 
is not predetermined to cause untimely death. Another kind of untimely 
Chapter 9 
death is that caused by injury by weapons etc. 
If there was no untimely death, the sages possessing divine insight, 
would not have advised to avoid combat with the untamed and voilent 
elephants, horses and enemies; use of contaminated air etc., adventures 
and unhealthy foods; nor would have advised adoption of activities to 
obtain the divine grace and use of rejuvinating medicines. Even they 
also did not get life as they desired (by fallowing these activities);_ learned 
men would not have been afraid of snakes, lion or elephants; constru­
ction of strong forts and citadels, protection from acts of killing, 
avoidance of sex with wives of others and such other activities would 
all be useless; persons who have become dead by the poison of venomous 
snakes would not have been brought back to life by the gods invited 
through the charms. By postponing the treatment, persons suffering from 
deseases like sanyasa ( coma) and rohiIJ.i (a fatal disease of the throat) 
would not die immediately, nor get back their life by immediate trea­
tment. Thousands of people are seen dying every day in war fighting 
each other, the life of even the pius men is not different; if there was 
no untimely death gods like Indra would not use weapons (to kill 
demons), the Asvinis would not have used medicinal plants to cure the 
sick; baked and unbaked pots would remain long or perish either by 
not guarding them or by guarding them respectively (unbaked pot existing 
long by protecting it wihile a baked perishing by not caring for it); The 
long or short life of drawings and paintings is commonly seen. Inspite 
of all these best exampl_es, the teachings of all the scriptures, and also 
by actually seeing untimely death, why do scholars debate on 
"it ? ( q3-1 04)

The death that occurs to a patient even with the availability of good 
physician and others (medicines, nurses), is designated as Kala m~tyu 
-timely death) the other one is opposite of it ( the Akala kind). ( 10 5)

Just as a chariot used in a proper manner undergoes slow decay only 
after ( expiry of) its expected life, so is the life of disciplined persons; 
whereas that of others will be opposite (meets with untimely death). 
Just as a lamp provided with clean oil, and, wick and not disturbed 
by insects and wind, continues to burn till the oil is used up fully, so 
also is the life. The opposite of these will cause the opposite kind of 
life (short life), similarly is the (effect of) indulgence in healthy and 
unhealthy things. ( 106-10~) 
Notes:-Proper use of the chariot means looking after it carefully, by repairing the 
broken parts immediately, putting lubricating oil to the axles, running it on good and 
even roads, not loading heavily etc. By improper use the chariot becomes mutilated, 
breaks up into pieces and become unusable, far earlier to its expected period of life). 
Likewise the life of a pers9n who maintains it propperly continues ot exist till the 
prescribed period whereas the life of that person who does not needto maintain it, 
becomes cut in the middle. The example of a lamp is also similar, it continues to burn 
till the presence of oil, wick and absence of disturbace by insects, etc., whereas it 
gets extinguished in the middle if the oil or wick is absent or if it disturbed by wind 
or insects. So also life continues to exist for the full period in the body of the person 
who protects it with healthy foods and from disturbing diseases while the life of the 
person who spoils it with unhealthy foods and frequent diseases, ends up in the middle 
itself:

Leaving aside all other things, the body is to be protected carefully; 
for, in its absence, a.11 other activities (of man) cease to exist. Just like 
Chapter 9 
the mayor for a city and the driver for a chariot (look after the city 
and the chariot) so also is an intelligent person for his own body, by 
attending to its work. ( 1 Qq-110.) 
Notes:-Every effort should be made to maintain the body in good condition. Without 
the body, nothing can be accomplished in this world. So it is the duty of e_very every 
person to protect it by healthy foods and activities and achieve the aims of life through 
it.

Persons should take healthy foods specially considering the different 
methods of preparing them and the very nature of the food materials, 
beacuse the body is produced (maintained) by food. ( 111)

In case, a self-conrolled person becomes a victim of diseases even 
after avoiding all unhealthy things, a wise man should consider it as 
due to divine will (or actions of the past life). Having got such diseases

ANNAPANA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
(Regimen of foods and drinks) 
~s- ;q Roll I t4 i 14 : I ~ fit ~f'i I §:<i ~ lU d_q') ft ~.f q : II ~ II 
We will now expound the chapter known as Annapana Vidhi -regin.1en 
of taking foods and drinks-; thus said Atreya and other great sages. ( 1) 
Annapana prayojanam (usefulness of food and drinks): 
~Pi~ dft-il q1-1 ~, A(q1thuq" -1141~'41 ~ 1 
"~'" m, Pt ~1Gt ttt\111\41 fF4 f.i.q◄~gll~~~ Rt .. ,u•q•~ Pt 1 ~ -qlifHI~: ~: I atBl'(M "4° ~ 11~11 
Authorities say that food and drinks partaken in a proper manner only, 
ore helpful for satisfying the senses and bestowing ling life. On it, depends 
the valour, growth, nourishment, intellegence and health ( of the person). 
It is the fuel for the internal fire and this fire is the chief support of 
the body. (2) 
Ahara kalpana vise$ah (factors related to food). 
~ ffltlclfi ~1•1ftf4i1<'41Sll{~lchiJ\qtt1•1&tctft4T: l-1 Hl~l<ct~.=tl f€I ~q1o1i 
~lt41fi4CJ;~l.=ti {g~: ~~ {tdttcll1'$~ I 
So, a self-controlled person should partake foods only after conside­
ring the ·seven factors related to food; such as; Svabhava (natural 
qualities) Sam.yoga (admixture) Samskara (processing) Matra (quantity) 
Desa (habitat) Kala (season) and Upayoga vyavastha (mode of using), 
which are the causes for either health or ill health. 
Notes:- There is a slight difference with regard to the number of factorsrelated 
to food between Caraka samhita and this text. Caraka counts eight such factors, the 
eighth factor being the Upayoktr -the user (the person who eats, his nature and 
constitution) whereas Vagbhata includes the 'user' under the factor Dcsa (habitat) itself: 
Annapana vidhi Adhyaya 
Ahara svabhava (nature of food material):

By their, Svabava (nature), rain water, red variety of rice, rice which 
matures in sixty days, greengram., meat of deer and lava bird (busturd 
quail) are easily digestible; whereas milk, sugercane juice, big sized 
rice, blackgram and meat of animals living in marahy region are not 
easily digestible. Even these undergo change to the opposite by the effect 
of sarilyoga (admixure) and other facors. ( 3) 
Ahara samyoga (admixture) -etc.,.:

Samy,~(admixture) is mixing two or more substances together. This 
union produces special effects not present in individual substances of 
the combination. 
Sarilskara (processing) is the result of contact with water and fire, 
washing, churnini, place, time, mode and vessel used for cooking. 
Notes: contact with water means soaking articles off ood in water to make them moist 
and soft; contact with fire includes roasting, frying, heating, burning, boiling in water 
frying in fats, cooking in steam, baking on a pan etc; the place of cooking and time 
of cooking, vessels used for cooking and preserving also influence the quality of food. 
preparing and preserving sour things in copper or brass vessels becoming poisonous 
is the best known example for this. -
Matra (quantity) is applicable to the total quantity of-food to be 
consumed and also to each item separately. Desa (habitat, place) refers 
to both the region in which the article of food is grown and also to the 
region where the user lives. Again here Upayokta (the user) of the food 
should be examined (understood) either as a healthy or unhealthy person 
and by the type of his constitution; (4l) \ ·, · ,, ,, '""' ·:.s

not used by others, not made hot for the second tin1e, not very hot, 
not overcooked, prepared well, and without too much of interest in it 
(in other words, without much greed or lust in eating). 
Food should not be one which is not accustomed to, which is not 
known, which is not mentioned in the texts; it should not be taken very 
late in the evening nor very early in the morning, in a very open place 
(without enclosing on any side), in sun light, in darkness, under a tr~e,

in vessel which is broken, not covered, not clean, that food thought 
to be bad even though might not be actually so; by holding the container 
or the food in his hand. 
The person should eat food sitting facing east, with a pleasant mind, 
served by clean, affectionate, unhungry and obedient people and that 
food suitable to him. 
Stale food s~ould not be taken except meat, upadamsa (pickles) 
bhak~ya (eatables which require good mastication); food which are 
preserved from the previous day should not be taken except curds, 
honey, ghee, liquid foods containing flour, soured whey and pudding 
prepared from milk. 
Food should contain fats ( oil, ghee etc.), be easily digestible and warm. 
It should not be eaten very leisurely or very hurriedly or accompanied 
with too much of talk and laughter. The person should eat food wHh 
relish and with a good knowledge of his ownself (his health, capacity 
of consumption etc.). (6)

Food which contains fat and which is easily digestible, kindles the 
fire in the abdomen ( digestive power), cleanses the alimentary tract, 
does not vitiate the tissues, gets digested quickly and causes the do­
wnward movement of Vata; produces pulmpiness of the body, postpones 
old age, increase strength and improves colour and complexion; food 
which is laghu ( easily digestible) does not harm the do~as and undergoes 
digestion without causing any difficulty even though it may become 
unsuitable slightly. 
Food which is u&na produces good taste (appetite) and dries up the 
Kapha. 
Person who eats food leisurely does not feel contented, eats large 
quantity, the food becomes cold and so acts like poison and does not 
get digested well. Person who eats very hurriedly, accompanied with 
too much ~f talk and laughter and whose mind is engaged with other 
things, will have his food going in through wrong passage, gets delayed 
in digestion; food does not stay in the alimentary tract to the required 
time and the person will not be able to experiance the good or bad of 
the food. (7)

Indian meal usually contains a staple food (rice, wheat, jawar, ragi etc.), curry or soup 
(prepared with vegetables or meat with liberal quantity of spices, sours and salt) a 
little quantity of pickles, (predominantly sour, saltly and bitter), sauces, fried eatables 
etc., as adjuvants. So it is a wholesome lood. Some people are fond of one or two 
tastes only than others and eat a little more of it. Though it is pleasant for them, its 
Jong continued use of any one or two tastes only is not good and will certainly cause 
disorders in them. Hence the advice to discontinue such habit even though it is pleasant 
for some time. Likewise the habit of using foods of all tastes should be cultivated 
gradually to maintain health.

Likewise Samasana, Adhyasana, Amatrasana and Vi~amasana should 
be avoided. Samasana is mixing healthy and unhealthy foods together, 
Adhyasana is taking food over the previous· food (before ~,he food taken 
earlier is digested), Amatrasana will be described later separately, 
(Chapter 11) Vi~amasana is taking food, too early or too late than the 
scheduled time. 
At the time of eating, peya (drinkables) yil~a (soup) rasa (mutton soup) 
and vyafijana (boiled vegetaples, sauces, pickles) should be kept in silver 
vessels; those which are dry, which adhere to the vessel, which are very 
hot and milk should be kept in gold vessels; khala (buttermilk boiled 
with sour substances and spices), khatwara (a preparation with pungent 
and sour substances for licking) kambalika (sour milk mixed with whey) 
should be kept in bronze vessels; raga~aqava (a sweet syrup compounded 
of grape,s,. pomagranates or mango along with ginger, cordomum, ghee 
etc.) and sattaka (buttermilk processed with cumin seeds) in beautiful

vessels made of diamonds and beryl; ghee in an iron vessel, cooked 
milk in copper vessels; drinking water, syrups and boiled rice in vessels 
of mud, gold, quartz or glass; all these being arranged in a wide and 
pleasant place; ,oth~rwise they will undergo change in their colour, smell 
and taste and become unfit for use. ( 9)

And further, bhak~ya (eatables) are to be arranged on the right side, 
peya (drinkables) lehya (lickables) and balls which require hard chewing 
are to be on the left side and bhojya (staple or the chief food) in the 
centre. 
Considering the digestive capacity and habituation, foods which are 
either watery or very dry (non-fatty) hard to digest, sweet and fatty 
should be consumed in the begining; those which are sour and salty in 
the middle and those which are dry (non-fatty) liquid and of oth~r tastes 
at the end. Those who have poor digestive capacity should consume 
liquid and warm foods in the begining itself, for the digestive activity 
getting stimulated by the heat, digest the other foods which are eaten 
later, in a proper way. (10)

, As an Anupana (after-drink, liquid to be taken after meals) water is 
the best because it is the chief source of all the tastes, it is accustomed 
to all living beings and possesses the properties of sustaining of life 
etc. It should be taken cold, after consuming curds, honey, barley, wheat 
and all other foods which cause burning sensation during digestion and 
is sarat (autumn) and grr~ma (summer) seasons. 
It should be taken hot after consuming foods prepared from corn flour 
and such other which are hard to digest; during hemanta (season of frost) 
and as described in the chapter on liquid substances ( Chapter 6) 
Milk as an after-drink is best after eating rice and rice which matures 
in sixty days; for those who are debilitated with fasting, long walk, 
speaking, sexual intercourse and exercise, and also for children and 
the aged. 
Meat soup is best for those who are emaciated by consumpiton and 
other diseases; sour syrups for those having disorders of Vata; sugarwa­
ter for disorder of Pitta; water boiled with triphala mixed with honey · 
for disease of Kapha and of the eyes and throat. 
Mastu (whey) or cold water are best after consuming dadhi (curds) 
kuchrka (ins pis sated buttermilk) and kilata (inspissated milk). 
Dhanyamla (sour gruel of cereals), mast\l (whey) or takra (buttermilk) 
are ideal after eating foods prepared with pulses, vegetables and coars~ 
·grains; 
Madya (wines) are ,good after consuming meat or the syrups of sour 
fruits, water or f ermcnted drinks; prepared in cold processing will be 
ideal depending upon the qualities, can also be used; especially madhva­
-sava (wine prepared from honey) after consuming meat of domesticated 
animals. 
Strong triphalasava after eating meat of animals. living in forests; 
Chapter 10 
nyagrodhadi phalasava (fermented liquids prepared from fruits of Vata 
and others)after meat of vi~kira birds; liquors prepared from arka, selu 
sirrsa, kapittha, after eating meat of animals which live in burrows and 
those killed by poisoned weapons; liquor prepared from sour fruits after 
eating meat of prasaha birds; liquors prepred from kasa, ik~u, seeds 
of lotus, si;-Iigataka, kaseruka, mtdwika and khadira mixed either with 
honey, cold water, or udaswit (buttermilk dilluted with water) after 
consuming meat of big game animals (lion, tiger, bison etc.,) and those 
living in water; sura (liquor prepared by distillation) after eating meat 
of pratuda birds and for persons who are fatigued by exertion and 
emaciated; water mixed with honey for those who are obese (fatty); 
madya (wine) for those who are habituated to wine and meat daily and 
who have poor digestion. In brief that liquid which possesses the 
properties opposite of that of the food and that which does not cause 
any harm to the person is the ideal ( after drink) ( 11)

An after-drink tones up the body, gives satisfaction, invigorates, 
. causes plumpiness, gives a feeling of contentment, makes the food move 
downwards easily, breaks the hard materials of the food, makes them 
soft, moistens them, helps for easy digestion and distribution to all the. 
parts of the body. 
After drink is to be avoided by those who are suffering from diseases 
of the parts of the body above the shoulders, dyspnoea, cough, excess 
salivation, hiccup, hoarseness of voice, injury to the chest and those 
who are indulging in too much of singing and speaking. For such persons, 
the afterdrink disturbs the stomach and chest, increases the moisture 
of the food in the throat and causes watery discharges from the tissues, 
Annapana vidhi Adhyaya 
indigestion, vomitting and other diseases. 
After taking such a drink, person should not indulge in speaking, 
singing, walking long distances and sleeping. 
Persons who are suffering from accumilation of moisture in the body, 
polyurea, diseases of the throat, eyes and ulcers should not take an 
af terdrink. ( 12) 
Notes:-Drinking of fluids after eating solid foods is a good habit and is prescribed 
as a daily routine. Whatever might have been the practice in ancient times but now 
a days only water is taken immediately after meals. The quantity of water or other 
fluids to be taken has not been mentioned above some how. As known to everybody 
it should be in moderate quantity, say about 11 quarter of a litre. Large amounts taken 
may cause vomitting or other discomforts and very little amounts may not be sufficient 
to the body. Solid foods will undergo proper digestion only after it is moistened well 
with water. So drinking moderate quantity of water after each meal should be cultivated

Ahara pari]Jamakara bhava {factors helpful for digestion): 
The following are the factors which bring about digestion of food, 
viz., heat, air, fat, moisture, time and proper combination; heat (fire-like 
activity inside the stomach) cooks the food; air ( or nervous activity 
causing peristailists and other movemnts of the stomach and intestines) 
causes downward movement of food; fat brings about softness; moisture 
breaks up the food particles; time makes the food (effect of food) to 
reach all the parts of the body; p'r'oper combination of all these factors 
helps to maintain the normalcy of the tissues. The factors responsible 
for proper combination of the above, are again, the suitable and healthy 
foods, the condition of the body, mode and procedure of eating, reclining 
and such activities and a pleasant mind. 
The qualities and properties of the digested food will ultimately 
assume the qualities and properties of the body (of the tissues) if such 
foods are not opposite ( of the qualities of the tissues). Foods which 
possess the opposite qualities (to those of the tissues) will destroy the 
body by assuming antagonistic qualities. ( 13)

Man should always eat a determined quantity of food. Such a quantity 
depends upon the digestive capacity and the nature of the food material. 
An ideal quantity is that which does not cause any discomfort in the 
abdomen, obstruction in the region of the heart, stretching pain in the 
flanks, too much of heavyness of the abdomen; which gives satisfaction 
to the sense organs, quenches hunger· and thirst, does nbt cause any 
difficulty for sitting, reclining, lieing, walking, inspiration and expira­
tion, speaking and reading; undergoes easy digestion both in the evening 
and morning, provides strength, colour (complexion) and stoutness to 
the body.(2)

The quantity of foods which are guru (hard to digest) is either 
threefourth or half of one's satisfaction; and for those which are laghu 
( easy to digest) it is that quantity which does not cause oversatisf action. 
Easily digestable foods possess the properties of Vata and agni 
(mahabhuta) preponderantly, stimulate the digestive activity because 
of identical properties and cause mild increase of do~c1s, if at all, by 
other ways. 
Others ·(foods which are not easily digestable) possess the properties 
of pi;thvi and ap (mahabhuta) preponderantly, are generally opposite 
(of the digestive activity) unless helped by exercises and stimulents of 
digestion.( 3) 
Notes: All the substances in this world are composed of the paricamahabhutas only, 
so also the articles of food and even the human body. The nature and properties of 
substances are according to the preponderance of one or more of the mahabhtitas in 
them. Tejas is the bhuta (element) responsible for heat and activities of heat., Food 
materials which possess this bhata in (element) responsible for heat and activities of 
heat. Food materials which possess this bhtita in greater proportion are easily digestable. 
inside the alimentary tract because it is Tejas itself that is present there which we 
call as Ko$fhagni (fire-like activity in the alimentary tract known also as digestive 
activity). Such foods undergo easy and quick digestion because of identical properties. 
The prthvi and ap bhatas possess properties opposite of tejas and food materials which 
possess these two bh tit as preponderantly diminish the capacity of the Ko$fagni ( digestive 
activity in the alimentary tract) and so do not undergo easy and quick digestion. In 
this way food materials are of two kinds· viz. Laghu-which are easily digestable and 
Guru-which are not easily digestable. Between them Jaghu foods do not cause much 
trouble to the body while guru foods cause many disturbances and diseases; occassional 
over eating of Jaghu foods may not cause trouble to the body but guru foods taken 
even slightly Jess than the usual quantity sometimes causes indigestion. So it is better 
to avoid taking guru foods in more quantities. 
Variation in quantity of food means either less or more than the usual 
fixed quantity.(3) 
Chapter 11 
Hlnamatra {inadequate quantity). 
The use of food which is less than the usual (determined, accustomed) 
quantity, causes diminition of strength, colour (a~d complexion), mental 
activity, intellegence and functions of the sense organs; produces 
constipation and loss of sexual vigour; does not help long life and good 
vigour; reduces the strength, creates inauspicious activities and becormes 
the cause for diseases of Vata origin to manifest in the body.(3) 
Atimatra {excess quantity): 
The use of food which is more than the usual quantity produces 
increase of all the do~as. Troubled by the food, Vata and other two do~as 
undergo quick increase, spread to all the parts of the abdomen; the food· 
without undergoing diges.tion stays for a long time inside the abdomen 
producing ( the disease) Alas aka or gets eliminated out of the body 
quickly both in downward and·upward directions producing (the disease) 
Vi~ucika. ( 3) 
Notes : The use of food either Jess or more in quantity may or may not produce 
the above mentioned symptoms and diseases on the same day but continued as a habit 
for some time will surely produce diseases. Eating excess quantity of food is more 
dangerous as it may produce the symptoms and diseases even on the same day.

Vata (undergoing increase predominantly) produces pain and diste­
ntion of the abdomen, bodyache, dryness of the mouth, delerium, 
tremors, fainting, giddiness, yawning, twisting pain, sunken eyes, severe 
pain in the head and heart, constriction of the veins and stiffness of 
the body parts; 
Pitta ( undergoing increase predominantly) produces fever, diarrhoea, 
burning sensation inside the body, discolouration, thirst, toxicity ( excite­
ment), giddiness and fainting (_loss of conciousness). 
Kapha (undergoing increase predominantly) produces vomiting, loss 
of appetite, salivation, weakness of the body parts, indigestion, prece1ded by chills, (rigors), and feeling of heavyness of the body. 
Specially in those people who are debilitated, of poor digestive 
activity, who have predominance of Kapha in their body and who 
habitually suppress the urges of flatus, urine and faeces; the food and 
drinks being forced by Vata but obstructed in their movement by Kapha 
are held up inside without moving out, and cause pain and other 
symptoms in greater degree but without vomiting and diarrhoea. This 
is Alasa. 
The do~as undergoing great increase, becoming obstructed (in their 
normal channels) by Arna, begin to move sidewards (in abnormal 
Chapter11 
channels), sometimes makes his body (of the patient of Alasaka) stiff 
like a wooden log. Such an Alasaka is said to be asadhya (incurable.)(6)

Those persons who indulge in incompitable (unhealthy) foods and 
overeating will becomes victims of Amado~a; it is also known as Amavi~a 
·because it produces symptoms similar to those of poison. It is incurable 
because of its quickness in action and complicated in treatment. 
'Foods will not give all their benefits only by their quantity; even their 
nature, etc., (admixture, processing) also bestow different benefits. (7) 
Notes : The ingested food undergoes digestion inside the alimentary tract by the 
Ko$f8gni (also called l8thar8gni, K6y8gni and and P6caka Pitta correspondeing to 
digestive activity brought about by different digestive juices such as gastric juice, bile, 
pancreatic juice, intestinal juice etc). If the Agni is normal, the food will be properly 
digested and the end product of digestion the essence of food-will be prepared well, 
fit to be assimilated by the tissues. If, on the other hand the Agni is weak (poor digestive 
activity) then the food will not be cooked properly and the final end product will be 
containing large amount of inadequately digested or uindigested food particles. These 
are known as Ama (uncooked, unprocessed, raw). Production of Ama which started 
inside the alimentary tract gradually invades the do$6S and through them spreads to 
the dh8tus (tissues) and the mal8s (waste products) also. This condition gives rise to 
many diseases. This concept of Ama and its effects is one of the important doctrines 
of pathology in Ayurveda.

Likewise, foods which are hard to digest, dry, (moistless), cold, the 
disliked; those which cause c9nstipation or burning sensation, which 
are dirty and incom~ables; drinking of large amounts of water; foods 
Matrasitiya Adhyaya 
which are mainly liquid, these taken at improper or proper time; foods 
and drinks taken by a person who is afflicted with lust, anger, greed, 
jealosy, shyness, grief, emotions, fear and hunger, are also going to 
produce Arna in the body.(8) 
Notes: The point to note here is the effect of various kinds of emotions on digestion. 
A calm and peaceful mind is very much essential for good digestion. Persons who 
are victims of such emotional upsets frequently get into different kinds of disorders 
of digestion sooner or later. Mere good and healthy food alone is not enough for proper 
digestion.

In those who have Amado~a, after the food gets digested. the ama~aya 
(stomach) will be found coated inside with a layer of a.ma, causing loss 
of movement, heavyness of the abdomen and lack of desire for food. 
In such a condition, the patient is to be given medicines to digest the 
un ,_!;gested pasty material and also to kindle the agni ( digestive f unct io 11). 
If the food has not be en digest c d such m c d kines ~~ho u 1 d not b c g l Y c n ; 
Matrasitiya Adhyaya 
because the Agni ( digestive activity) will have been ,veakened by both 
the amado~a and the food and it will not be able to digest the medicine. 
(23) 
Notes : It is needless to say that digestion of food will be improper when once 
ama do$a gets formed inside. Some times the food undergoes digestion to some extent 
and some quantity moves forward to the intestines while more remains inside the 
stomach itself causing discomfort. At that stage digestive drugs are to be given.

Further, the diseases caused by amado~a being very powerful because 
of the weakness of the agni ( digestive activity) they may kill the patient 
suddenly.(24)

Again, the diseases caused by amado~a can be cured only by 
Apatarpal)a. It is of three kinds; Latighana, (fasting), Latighana-pacana 
(fasting combined with digestice t~erapies) and Avasecana (forceble 
elimination or expulsion). 
Latighana is indicated when the ama do~a is mild. It enhances the agni 
( digestive function) and Vata which cause disappearance of little amount 
of amado~a, just as little amount of water in a tank disappears by the 
(action of ) wind and sun. 
When the amado~a is profound only Avasecana (expelling it out by 
force) should be done; Just as the crops in a field do not grow well 
unless the excess water, and silt are drained out. ( 2 5)

For such of the diseases which are caused by Saii.tarpaIJ-a (excess food 
intake, over-nutrition) there is no treatment other than ApatarpaIJ-a 
(fas ting, intake of less food, undernutrition); for diseases caused by 
ApatarpaIJ-a there is no treatment other than saiitarpaIJ.a. 
This (principle) is applicable to other diseases also; the treatment 
should be done by the use of drugs (or therapies) opposite of the causes 
of the disease. If there is combination (of do~as or diseases) then the 
treatment shall be the use of drugs ( or therapies) opposite of the 
diseases, discarding the use of drugs (or therapies) opposite of the 
causes, or it may be the use of drugs (ot therapies) which give the same 
effect (opposite effect though not actually opposite drugs). 
Notes: Ordinarily the first principle of treatment of disease is the avoidance of 
the cause or use of drugs which possess qualities opposite to the cause. In some diseases 
which are caused by diverse kinds of causes or when more than one disease is present 
in the body, the treatment has to be the use of drugs or methods of treatment which 
are opposite of the disease proper. Some times it may even be the use of drugs or 
methods which are not actually opposite of the disease but still produce the opposite 
effect of curing the disease. (Tadarthaknri cikitsa). 
After the amado~a has been resolved but some residue of it still 
remaining and the person having good digestive capacity, he should be 
given oil massage -and bath, decoction enema, oil enema and many kinds 
of drinking of fats, carefully considering the condition of the do~as, 
dhatus and other factors. ( 2 6) 
Notes : Amado$a does not remain in the alimentary tract only but spreads even 
to the tissues all over the body. Oil massage and bath in hot water bring such 8mado$a 
from the tissues all over the body to the alimentary tract, and the two types of enemas 
Matrasitiya Adhyaya 
will help in eliminating 8mado$a from the alimentary tract.

AjirQ.a (indigestion) is of three kinds viz AmajirQ.a from the increase

Even Vilarfibika is due to accumilation of large amounts of amado~a 
in the alimentary tract. The symptoms and treatment of this disease 
is the same as of ama associated with Kapha and Vata. ( 3 5)

In case of Rasase~ajirl).a there will be aversion to food, impurity in

having this condition should be ask~d to sleep during day without taking 
any food and later take light foods if he feels hungry.(36) 
Notes : Rasase$8}Tr1Ja is the condition in which the end product of digestion has 
little amounts o[ 8ma {undigested or unprocessed materials) remaining in it. This being 
a very mild condition does not require any drug treatment. The symptom, "impurity

A period of four yamas (twelve hours) and two yamas (six hours) are 
required for the proper digestion of food and medicines respectively. 
It may be earlier than these periods if the Agni ( digestive activity) is 
powerful and late if the agni is w~ak. (37)

Hence, medicines are to be administered along with food itself to 
persons who have poor digestive ability, because the food taken in the 
morning is accustomed to, easily digestable, kindles digestion and 
nourishes the body.( 3 8)

Even if the food taken in the forenoon is not digested well, taking 
food again in the night does not cause any harm, whereas if the food 
taken at night is not digested well, taking food the next morning will 
defenetely cause harm.(39)

During day, the heart will be open by the effect of sunHght just like 
the lotus flower opens at the sight of the sun; because of that all the 
channels of the body become clear and active. The dhatus (tissues) do 
not become laden with moisture during day-time because of exercise 
(physical activity) and mental activity being more. When the channels 
are not having excessive moisture, the food taken do not cause much 
harm. Just as the uncooked milk does not become spoiled by admixture 
of any other kind of milk.(40-42)

At nights, the heart will be closed, all the channels also will have been 
closed, all the dhatus (tissues) will be having more moisture, which even 
comes to the alimentary tract. Thus getting too much of moisture it 
becomes full of other undigested materials also and causes harm, just 
as cooked milk gets spoiled when it is mixed with other milk. Hence, 
if the food taken in the night has not been digested well, the next meal 
should not be partaken again.(43-44.) 
Notes : In ancient times people firmly believed that heart is the seat of all activities 
of both the body and mind and that the function of the heart is very active during 
day and Jes during nights. Hence the descr_iption of its opening and closing akin to 
that of the lotus flower. The other changes taking place in the alimentary tract and 
the tissues are also different between day and night. There is much truth in these 
descriptions as seen in the light of the present day knowledge also. 
All the organs and tissues of the body will be more active during day than during 
night. During day man being physically active, all the moisture secreted by the tissues 
will be -excreted out; whereas during night man being inactive and engaged in sleep 
for about ten or twelve hours, the excretary functions will also be withheld. So, much 
of the moisture secreted by the tisues accumilates within them. In this manner almost 
all the functions of the body are more efficient during day than during night.

one serves the purpose of the other also, their separate mention in view of their 
importance. Urjaskara (which promotes health and vigour) is again of two kinds; 
Rasayana (rejuvination) and Vajikarru:ia(virilification). Rogaghna (that which 
cures diseases) is also of two kinds, Prasamana (that which mitigates the disease) 
and Apunarbhavakara (that which prevents the recurrance of disease). They are

vanaspati, those which bear flowers and (then) fruits are vanaspatya;creepers and 
bushes are Y-rrudh and those which perish after their fruits mature are o~adhi; 
Honey, ghee and other products of animals are Jafigama. (2)

Treatment is again of three kinds; Apakar~al).a (elimination), Pralqti vighata 
(mitigation) and Nidanatyaga (avoidance of cause); each of the.se three are again 
of two kinds -Bah ya ( external) and Abhyafitara (internal). External elimination 
(removal) is done in diseases like tumors, malignant growths, extra eye-lashes, 
parasites and foreign bodies by the use of the instruments, hands and other 
applicances; internal elimination is by emesis, purgation and other methods. 
Pralqtivighata is Samsamana (mitigation or alleviation of the disease); use of 
oil massage; sudation (fomentation), applying poultices, pouring decoction or 
other liquids and mild massage are the internal methods of mitigation; these 
methods acting inside the hody mitigate the disease without increasing the do~as. 
Nidanatyaga (avoidance of cause) is avoidance of cold, heat, food, exercise 
and use of things which are unctous, dry etc., in accordance with do~as. 
In diseases which require surgical treatment, the use of medicine is also 
applicable but in diseases which can be treated by medicines, surgery is not 
applicable. ( 4)

dry and hot in diseases caused by materials which are heavy, unctious, and cold; 
likewise for the others; Vyadhiviparita (opposite of the disease) is of two kinds (a)

-some materials ( drugs, foods or activities) though possessing the property of 
mitigating the increased do~as in general, are found to be specifics for certain 
diseases; for exmple, musta, parpataka and yavagu (thin rice gruel) are best suited 
for Jvaras (fevers); rajani and yava in prameha (polyurea); purgation therapy in 
upward bleeding, and emesis therapy in downward ~leeding etc._ 
Ubhayarthakari (treatment which serves the purpose of both -.hetuviparita 
( opposite of the cause) and vyadhi Viparita ( opposite of the disease) -includes all 
the methods enumerated under Daivavyapasraya; emesis to cure vomitting, 
purgation to cure diarrhoea, alcoholic drinks to cure alcoholism, application of heat 
to remove the bum caused by tuttha ( copper sulphate), sudation therapy or use of 
pungent, sour, salty, penetrating and hot substances to bring out the Pitta which is 
either hidden inside, or localised in any one place and restore it to its normal routes; 
application of cold and other cold comforts which makes the body heat to move 
deep inside and liquify tne Kapha which is deep seated and immobile. These and 
many such methods even though not opposite in nature act as opposite of both the 
cause and the disease. (6)

Drugs and diseases being innumerable, the recipes also are innumera­
ble. Those which are very efficacious and so used widely, are given 
specific names like Jrvanrya (promoters of longevity) etc. Herein are 
described fortyfive such recipes, each group containing ten drugs. This 
is only to serve as a guide to those of poor intellect and as example 
only for the highly int.ellegent. Intellegent persons by noting the general 
properties like sweetness, cold potency, unctousness etc., found in the 
drugs of Jivaniya group etc., will be able to understand and indentif y 
such properties even in other materials like k~rra (milk) ik~u (sugercane) 
drak~a, ak~oda, vidarikafida etc. But it will be wise on the part of the 
less intellegent to adhere to these groups only. 
Counted separtely, the total number of drugs will be four hundred 
and fifty. Even though each one by itself is a recipe, yet grouping them 
MAHAKA~AYASANGRAHA ADHYAYA 
together under specific names do not contradict their actions; because each one can 
be used for 1nore than one purpose. 
Drugs of all the tastes except salt, are known as ka~ayas in the context of 
preparing recipes, because they are the source (materials); preparations of extracts 
( decoction) etc., from salt, not being possible, usage and utility of salt individually 
being little, it is not useful (for preparing recipes). (2)

H~re (in this science of Ayurveda) '' every substance is made up of 
the Paficamahabhutas -~ ( the five gross elements)- only; p~thvI is its 
substratum (bulk, mass), udaka (ap) its origin (that from w~ich it grows), 
kha (akasa), anila (Vata) and anala (tejas) are its other parts; intimate/ 
inseparable) union of all these is the cause of its origin and also of its 
peculiarity (difference between one substance and the other); its name 
is derived from the (bhuta) predominant in it; being composed of 
intimate union of all the bhutas, every substance possesses more than 
one taste; hence, diseases also are caused by more than one do~a. (2) 
Notes:-Ayurveda has adopted the Paiicamahabhrlta theory from the Sankhya system 
of Philosophy. According to this doctrine, all the substances in this u11iverse are 
composed of the Paiicamahabhutas only. The union of these five is intimate (insepara­
ble} but their proportion varies from one substance to the other. Depending upon 
the bhrlta which is predominant in it that substance is grouped !n that category. For 
example, the substance which has predominance of Prthvibhrlta is called 'Parthiva' 
substa11ce, that which has predominance of Apbhuta as Apya substance and so on. 
Sub:,tances have some common features and some peculiar features also. 
No two substances are exactly identical in all respects. They are differentiated from 
one another by their peculiar features. This will be described further.

In a substance, the Rasa (primary or chief taste) is clearly perceptible; 
the Anurasa (secondary taste) is not perceptible as it is covered ( over 
-powered, subjugated) by the rasa (primary taste) or becomes percepti­
ble slightly at the end. 
Chedana (expulsion of the do~as) and upasamana (alleviation or 
mitigation of the do~as) are the two functions of the tastes; becoming 
good or bad (for health) are their prabhava (special effects). 
The qualities such as guru (heaviness) etc., found in substances.., 
belonging to 12r.thivi etc, by their very nature, t_ransformation, pr~ce­
ssing, region and season but are attributed categorically to the Ra~as 
(tastes} because of their coexistence. ( 3) 
Notes:-Rasa is the first and chieftaste that is understood immediately a substance 
is putintothe mouth. Anurasa is not very distinctly perceptible or is understood slightly 
after some time. The rasa and anurasa may be one or more. They are described as 
haviI1g the qualities like guru (heaviness, hard to digest), laghu (light in weight, easy 
to digest) slta (cold in potency), u~JJa(hot in potency) etc. but strictly speaking_, these 
are the quf)litieS of the bhutas (gross elements), which are present in the substance. 
It is onlya categorical auribution and fhould not be taken as actual. It is the qualities 
ofthe substances and not of Rasas that are te>_ be noted from different aspects as 
stated above;

Depending upon their chief functions, the bhtlta responsible for those 
functions are to. be tak~n as predominant in such substances. For 
example, the substance which is grahI(having the property of absorbing 
water) will have predominance of V ayu bhiita,those which are cleepana­
pacana (appetisers and digestives) are having predominance of Agni 
(tejas) bhiita, those which are having the property of lekhana (scarifica-

Yet others say 
'' Vfrya is that property of a substance, which is the chief active 
principle; without Virya there is no function and all functions are done 
by Vfrya itself''. They argue that even though the above mentiened eight 
are powerful among the important functionaries (active principles) in 
a substance and even though these eight are accepted by the sciences 
(authorities and authoritative texts of Ayurveda) yet it is only a customa­
ry (usual, general) statement. Let it be so. They accept that among the 
rasa (taste), vipaka (end product of digestion) and guQ.as (qualities), 
these (eight qualities) are more powerful, so they should be considered 
as vfrya. During the description of substances even the texts make 
special mention of these factors. So also, it is accepted by th~ science, 
that the total effect of a substance is its prabhava (speciality, specific 
action). Even though the rasas are also the cause of different functions, 
still they are not called either as vfrya or prabhava (and accepted as . 
such). (18-19) 
Notes:- The above statement pertains to those scholars who put forth the 'Bahu vidha 
vTrya or Ananta vrrya siddhanta-Doctrine of multiple potency'. According to them 
whichever is the powerful factor in a substance which does an important function, 
that is to be called as the vlrya (potency} of that substance. It may be any 011e of 
the six tastes, one of the twenty qualities like guru, Jaghu etc., the very mass of the 
substances, or even the colour, smell, touch or sound of the substance.

Still others argue that the qualities such as guru, laghu etc., and seasons 
(such as "&isira, vasanta etc.) are having the predominance of only two 
elements agni (fire, heat) and ~oma (cold). So Vfrya also is only of two 
kinds, hot and cold. Even though the substances are having many 
qualities in them, heat and cold are more powerful than all others and 
Dravyadi Vijfianiya Adhyaya 
the rest are within the scope of these two only, just as all the things 
of the world are of only two kinds- the manifest and the unmani­
f est. (20-21 ). 
d:t)wi <:_~.:tqi4•H4<:_.:tfc1Mtt.:tl~M~Cf.~IJ4'1if.:t ~()fit 11~~11 
Among these two, the U~IJ.a vfrya (hot potency) attends to functions 
such as burning, cooking (digesting), perspiration, liquification and 
mitigation of Vata and Kapha. (22)

The Sita vfrya (cold potency) produces contentment (satisfaction), 
obstruction (withholding, stopping, preventing), supporting life (mai­
ntenance, sustenance, protection of essential functions of life), mitiga­
ting the blood, Pitta and others. (23) 
Thus vfrya (potency) has been described so far. 
Notes:- This is the Dwividha vrrya siddhanta- the doctrine of two potencies. The 
proposers of this doctrine accept the predominance of heat and cold in all the factors 
of creation and maintain that it should be the same in respect of the actions of the 
substances as well. This theory has received wider support and all Ayurvedic authorities 
have finally accepted it, being simple and comprehensive. 
Vipaka (taste after digestion):-

Further on Vipaka will be described : 
Vipaka (taste at the end of digestion) is generally sweet for sweet 
and salt tastes; sour for sour taste and pungent for the others (tastes). 
Thus ( vipaka) is similar to the taste, in its effect (actions).(24) 
~oq~o1~~qo1 i41f41~H-P·J.r~4Rcl~4M~ 11~c._11 
Its mild, moderate or great effects are dependent-upon the peculiarities 
of the substance and its qualities. (25) 
Notes :-Vipaka is the taste of the substance after its digestion in the alimentary 
tract. The original taste of some substances continues to be the same even after 
Chapter 17 
digestion. Whereas, the original taste of some others, undergoes change into another 
after digestion. The effect of both the original taste and that after the digestion, though 
the same, there will be variation in the degree of their action; depending upon other 
factors.

Those who say that the v ipaka of pungent, bitter and astrigent tastes 
is pungent only, will not be able to justify that bitter and astringents 
(vipakas) mitigate Pitta.(27) 
Notes:- Panishara opines that the vipakas are three but in a different manner, viz. 
sour and pungent tastes remain the same even after digestion, while sweet, salt, bitter 
and astringent will be transformed into sweet. He finds difficulty to accept pungency 
at the end of digestion to bitter and astringent tastes, because pungent taste or vipaka 
can only increase Pitta but·cannot mitigate it as has been described in the texts. The 
solution to his objection is given by, Vagbhata himself in the next paragraph.

Substances which are sweet both in taste and at the end of digestion 
possess cold potency; substances which are sour both in taste and at 
the end of digestion possess hot potency; substances which are pungent 
in taste and also at the end of digestion possess hot potency. The actions 
of such substances like increasing or mitigation of do~as, are generally, 
due to the tastes present in such substances. As for example (the actions 
of ) milk, wine and pepper. (2 8) 
Dravyadi Vijiianiya Adhyaya 
Notes :-lndu the commentator explains the examples as follows- Milk is sweet 
in taste and also at the end of digestion and possesses cold potency, it tends to increase 
Kapha and mitigate vaata and Pitta just as sweet taste does these actions; wine is 
sour in taste and also,at the end of digestion and possesses hot potency, it tends 
to mitigate Vata and incr:ease Pitta and Kapha just as sour taste does; pepper is pungent 
both in taste and at the end of digestion and possesses hot potency, it tends to mitigate 
Kapha and increase Vata and Pitta just as pungent taste does. Hence it is the taste . 
that is the deciding factor.

If there is a mixture of tastes, then it (the actions) is quite different, 
For example; honey though sweet mitigates Kapha by its katuvipaka (by 
becoming pungent after digestion), increases Vata by its possessing 
astringent taste, dryness and cold potency. So also, barley. 
Meat of animals of marshy places and those which live in water though 
cold, increases Pitta by its hot potency; sesamum oil causes obstruction 
of faeces and urine mainly by being pungent at the end of digestion; 
kafijika (sour gruel) mitigates Kapha by its dryness and hot potency; 
kapittha mitigates Pitta by being dry and cold in potency; . amalaka 
(mitigates) Pitta by its cold .potency and sweet vipaka, Kapha by its 
dryness and lightness, but it does not mitigate Vata because of its cold· 
potency, dryness and lightness; saindhava salt mitigates Pitta by its sweef· 
vipaka and also Kapha by its lightness; suQthi and pippalf though pungent 
Chapter 17 
mitigate Vata by their unctuousness, hot potency and sweet vipaka, so 
also lasuna by its unctuousness, hot potency and heaviness; palaIJ.QU 
by its unctuousness and heavyness increases Kapha; so also the mulaka 
which is fully ripe, by its sweet vipaka; vyaghri, visalya, arka and aguru 
which are unctuous and bitter increase Pitta by their being hot in potency; 
mahatpaficamula which is astringent and bitter in taste mitigates Vata 
but not Pitta because of its hot potency; similarly tulattha which is 
astringent by its sour vipaka (mitigates Vata not Pitta); all the above 
are just a few examples only. (29).

Hence, (it should be understood- that) some substances act by their 
rasa (tastes), some others by their vipaka (taste at the end of digestion) 
some by their gul).a (qualities), some by their vfrya (potency) and still 
others by their prabhava (special effect). (30)

Among the different factors ( causes of actions) such as .r asa etc., 
whichever is more powerful, that overrules others (makes the actions 
of others insignificant), that comes to be called as "the cause" (chief 
cause). (31) 
Pci~;.«1o1fi~'1tJ ~llftl~ ~ Gflqfl 11~~11 
In case of coexistence of opposing factors, the weaker one is vanqui­
shed by the stronger. ( 3 2) 
Notes :-Stated in simple terms, there are many factors which are the cause~· of 
actions, such as, the substa11ce in toto, the six tastes, the twenty qualities, the two 
potencies, the three tastes after digestion a11d some special effects. Each one, though 
capable of action, will 11ot be equally powerful. Any one factor will be more powerful 
and that factor subjugates the actions of all the rest. Such powerful cause is given 
unportance and described as the real cause or chief cause; all the others become 
iI1significant.

When the rasa and others· (vipaka, vrrya and prabhava) are of equal

Even though rasa and others are opposed to one another in their

Notes :-The guIJa indicated here refers to satva, Ia}as a11d tamas; Each one of 
these is opposite to the other and exist together in the human body without destroying 
one another. Similarly also the Tri dos.is -though of opposite qualities, they co-exist

The differences in the factors su~h as rasa (taste); vrrya (potency)

Sweetness, coldness, slimyness, unctuousness, heaviness and slo­
wness are all present If! milk in a certain manner but not so ( exactly 
in the same manner) in the meat of animals of rnarshy places and of 
those living in water. (36) 
Notes:- The proportio11 of the bhtltas varies from one substance to the other. Because 
of this reason, no two substances are exactly similar. There is a definite difference 
between honey and sugar in their sweetness. Similarly the example of milk and meat 
of aquatic animals is to show that there will be variation in their qualities -however 
subtle it might be -though both are described as possessing identical qualities.

The qualities, described as present in the substances are the causes 
for the normalcy, increase and decrease of the dos as and the human 
body. Hence, the substances are the causes for changes in the do~as 
and also the body. (37) • 
Notes:- In other words the normal and abnormal conditions of the three dos.is of 
the human body are brought about by the substances which are used either as food 
or drug. 
The use of substances which have qualities similar to those of the dos.is causes 
increase of the dos.is while the use of substances of opposite qualities cause their 
decrease.

putting a substance on the tongue, Vfrya (potency) and Vipaka (taste 
after digestion) are understood after their functions. ( 3 8)

Some might say ''accepting tastes as only six may not be tenable 
because differences are seen in sweetness etc., in substances such as 
ghee, oil, jaggery (molasses) etc. enumerated under -ntadhura skaiidha 
(group of sweet substances)''. Let such differences be innumerable or 
be one and the same by non-recognition (of such differences), these 
Dravyadi VijiUiniya Adhyaya 
small differences are attributed to the greater or lesser proportion of 
the bhutas, existing together in the substance which is not so much 
differentiated and described in detail. So also the differences in qualities 
such as heaviness etc., though innumerable are not counted separately 
because they all form one single category only. Likewise is the case 
with rasas (tastes) also. 
The property of adhering to the mouth is seen in ghee and others 
but not found in da(jima fruit and others. Hence, the tastes aTe only 
six, even though there are innumerable variations under each one of 
them. Not being of any practical utility no treatise has described them 
(the variations in tastes. (39-43) 
Notes:-As stated earlier, the variation in the proportion of the bhiita; elements is 
the cause for difference between one substance and the other. The same is the cause 
for the variations in the qualities of substances also. Even among substances ofany 
one taste there are differences between one another in the nature and degree of that 
taste. Substances grouped together taking into consideration the main taste but not 
its minute variations. It is not also possible to differentiate every variation as there 
are myriads of substances in this world. Hence, nowhere we find the description of 
minute variations. He11ce the objection on the theory of the six tastes is overruled.

The view of some 'that v ipaka is six, one for each taste' is not feasible; 
the vipaka of vrihi (rice) which is sweet in taste, is going to be sour, 
whereas that of dac;lima is not sour even though it is of sour tasfe; 
sesamum oil becomes pungent but not pippali which is pungent by taste; 
hence v ipaka is not the same as that of the rasa; for it is seen that 
yava though sweet and heavy is going to cause increase of Vata, ghi,-ta 
(butter-fat) even though cold in potency kindles hunger; vasa (muscle­
-fat) though hot in potency weakens the digestive power, mudga though 
becomes pungent after digestion is going to mitigate Pitta whereas ma~a 
causes increase of Pitta; phaQita (half-cooked molasses) though beco­
ming sweet after digestion and possessing qualities like unctuousness, 
hot and heavy, is going to increase Vata. 
Just as in the case of sweet taste, even the other tastes also ( show 
variations); the fruits of ak~a though sour in taste increases Vata and 
mitigates Kapha and Pitta; dadhi though h~avy (ha_rd t~ digest) kindles 
digestion while the meat of peigon does not; kapittha and dac;lima though 
sour in taste, are grahi (water absorbant) but the fruits of amalakf is 
not so; dhatakI which is astringent (in taste) and cold in potency acts 
as grahi (water absorbant) but not so the harftaki. 
So also, rasa (taste) and other factors taken individually (separately) 
are insignificant ( unimportant, not powerful) becaus:e .all . these are 
residing in the substance (as its parts) ,and it is the sub.stance which 
has prabhava (special effects); hence the view that the substance is the 
most important (45-52) 
Dravyadi Vijiianiya Adhyaya 
Notes:-The above examples are meant to discard some views which are not tenable 
and to justify the theories of the six rasas, three vipakas, eight or two vlryas, and 
importance of Dravya and not ofits individual qualities.

Special ( or peculiar) action of a particular substance, ·seen even ·when 
its rasa (taste) and other factors are similar with those of another 
substance- such actions are said to be caused by the Prabhava of that 
particular substance. 
Dafiti though similar to ~itraka in taste and other qualilties, produces 
purgations; madhuka and m{dwfka though similar, m{dwrka acts as a 
purgative but not so madhuka; ghee and milk though similar, ghee kindles 
digestion whereas milk does not; lasuna by its pungent taste and also 
vipaka, unctuousness and heaviness mitigates Kapha and Vata but does 
not cause in.crease of Vata and Kapha by the same qualities; lohitasali 
(red variety of rice) and others· mitigate the three do~as, though each

is of different qualities whereas yavaka (small sized barley) and others 
cause the increase of the do~as prompted by Prabhava; siri~a and others 
decrease the effect of poison whereas sleep etc, cause its increase; 
Removal of foreign bodies, birth of male children, protection against 
evil, life span, increase of intellegence, attraction of other persons and 
such other different actions of precious stones, holy chants and potent 
herbs are all ( due to prbhava itself). 
The effects of poison being brought under control by the mere sight 
of the anti poisonous recipes; some aphrodisiac substances causing quick 
elimination of semen while some others cause its quick increase in 
quantity; purgatives and emetics producing large bouts even with small 
doses; the ·actions of palliative drugs described in detail earlier are all 
due to Prabhava itself. Hence it (prabhava) is un-understandable (unpre­
dictable, inconceivable). (52-59)

We will now expound the chapter called Rasabhedrya (differentiation 
of tastes) -thus said Atreya and other great sages. ( 1) 
Rasotpatti (origin of tastes):

Rasa (taste) is Apya (born from Ap mahabhuta) and is unmanifest 
in the beginning. Due to the (effect of) six i;tus (seasons) of time, the 
mahabhutas (primary elements) combine in varying proportions in 
dissimilar unions (in substances) undergo processing further (by tejas 
or heat) and thus the Rasa· (taste) gets differentiated into six kinds such 
as sweet etc.(2) 
Notes:-Ap bhuta is the primary cause for taste and without its presence taste cannot 
manifest at all. When Ap bhuta remains alone, the taste, though present in it cannot 
be perceived because it is so very subtle (unmanifest). Mahabhutas (the moities of 
five primary elements} combine in different proportions and become converted into 
gross substances, this process continues uninturrupted, in time. When substances 
become grosser and grosser the qualities of each of the mahabhutas become manifest 
(patent} and perceptible (recognisable}. The combinations ofmahabhatas in a substa­
nce is the cause for the presence and manifestation of tastes. The disproportionate 
union of mahabhutas is _the cause for innumerable kinds of substances, so also their 
peculiar qualities including the tastes. Depending upon the predominance of one or 
other bhutas substances as classified as Parthiva, Apya, Taijasa, Vayav1ya, and 
Nabhasa. Even in each category there are innumerable variations in respectof qualities 
and also the tastes.

Chapter 18 
Sweet taste is formed by the predominance of Bhu (p~thvf) and Jala 
(ap) (during the union of mahabhutas to form gross substances); predo­
minance of Bhu (p~thvr) and Tejas is the cause for sour taste; Jala (ap) 
and Tejas produce salt tasJe; Vata and Akasa produce bitter taste; Vata 
and Tejas produce pungent taste; Vata and urvi (p~thvf) produce 
astringent taste. ( 3)

Among them, Svadu (sweet taste) forms a coating inside the mouth, 
gives pleasure to the sense organs, provides happiness to the body and 
is very much liked by flies, ants. etc. 
Amla ( sour taste) stimulates (irritates) the tongue, produces burning 
sensation in the chest and throat, causes watering of the mouth (saliva­
tion), makes the person close his eyes and brows (tightly), produces 
a feeling of chills (pins and needles) inside the teeth and causes 
horripilations (body hairs standing on their ends). 
LavaQa (salt taste) causes too much of salivation in the mouth, burning 
sensation in the throat and cheeks and makes the food tasty. 
Tikta (bitter tast~) cleanses the mouth (of its sticky accumulationsL 
clears the throat and hinders perception of other tastes. 
Ka(u (pungent taste) gives severe stimulation, irritates the tip of the 
tongue, throat and cheeks; causes watery discharge from the mouth, 
eyes and nose; and a feeling of burning sensation in the body. 
Ka~aya (astringent taste) inactivates the tongue, obstructs the throat 
and produces discomfort in the heart (region of the heart). ( 4)

Sweet taste, being accustomed since birth, • makes for the growth

is good for children, the aged, the wounded, and the emaciated; also 
for improving the strength, colour ( complexion) keenne~s of sense 
organs, health of the skin, hairs and throat; it provides contentment, 
stoutness, supports life activities, nourishes the body, gives stability; 
produces breast milk., mitigates Vata, Pitta, poisons, bun-iing sensation, 
fainting and thirst; is .snigdha. (unctuous), sHa (cold. in potency), mi;-du

sour substances generally increase Pitta except dacjima and amalaka; 
salts are generally bad for the eyes except saindhava; substances 
possessing bitter and pungent tastes generally increase Vata and are 
non-aphrodisiacs, except am:r;ta, patolf, nagara, pippali and la~una; 
astringent substances are generally cold in potency and cause obstru­

green grass, trees with wide spreading branches, decked with tender 
leaves and flowers; numerous categories of flora, reptiles (animals) and 
birds; producing grains and water which are hard (not easily digestible) 
and which cause increase of Kapha and Pitta; large number of persons 
in the community suffering from diseases like filariasis, diseases _?f the 
throat, scrofula,knlarged lymph glands and fever etc., is known as Anupa 
de.sa (forest region) and it is the produ'cer of sweet substances. (28)

The land which is abundant in uneven and vast sand dunes; sources 
of water very far, deep (concealed) and water not tasty·; inhabited by 
people who are capable of enduring hardship, not suffering from any 
disease, and long lived; the land having features opposite of those of 
Anupa (forest land) is known as Jaiigala ( deseryarid land) and is the 
source of pungent substances. (28) 
Between them, two other subdivisions are to be noticed, Aniipa""Sadh­
araQa and Jaiigala- sadharaQa; the former is the source of salt and sour 
substances and the latter of the remaining (bitter and astringent) substa­
nces.(29) 
Notes:- The word ~SadharaJJa' denotes the land with mixed features of both kinds. 
Region which will have more features of Amlpa ·and Jess of Jangala is called as 
Anupa-sadharaqa (semi-forest) and that with more features of Jarigala and Jess of 
Anupa will be Janga/a-sadharaJJa (semidesert).

Rasa (plasma) provides a sense of satisfaction, nutrition (to the tissues) and 
nourishment to rak:ta (blood); Rakta (blood) sustains life activities, imparts colour 
( complexion) and nourishment to marhsa (muscle tissue); Marhsa covers the body, 
nourishes the waste products and medas (adipose tissue); Medas provide moistness 
of the eyes and also of the body, lubrication, stability and nourishment to asthi 
(bone); Asthi helps the maintenance of erect posture and nourishment to majja 
(bone marrow); Majja confers moistness (lubrication) strength, fills the cavity of 
the bones and gives nourishment to sukra (reproductive tissue); sukra furnishes 
happiness, strength and production of the foetus. 
Priikrta Mala karma (functions of normal waste products): 
Salqt (faeces) gives strength and supports Vata and Pitta; Mutra (urine) 
eliminates the excess moisture of the food; Sveda (sweat) maintains the moistness 
(greasiness) of the skin and supports the hairs (of the skin). (2). 
Note: The above are the important functions of the Do~iis, Dhiitus and Maliis when 
they are in their normal condition. Each of them, has many other functions also.

Salqt (faeces) undergoing k~aya (decrease) causes movement of flatus 
associated with sound in sideward and upward directions, twisting of the intestines, 
appearance of pain in the flanks and region of the heart and little quantity of the 
faeces. 
Mutra (urine) undergoing k~aya (decrease) produces pricking pain in the 
bladder, dryness of the mouth, elimination of little quantity of urine, with difficulty 
and of different colours or mixed with blood. 
Sveda (sweat) undergoing k~aya (decrease) causes stiffness of the hair 
follicles, falling of hairs, cracking, loss of sensation and roughness of the skin and 
scanty perspiration. (6) 
Notes : From the foregoing description it becomes clear that the increase and 
decrease of the do~iis, dhiitus and maliis are abnormal and they produce many trouble 
some symptoms. Hence, both the words 'Vrddhi' and 'K~aya' are used to convey 
abnormal conditions. But while extolling the properties of some efficient medicinal 
recipes and in some other places the term 'Vrddhi • has been used asa synonym to denote 
Upacaya or healthy xrov:;th of certain dhiitus of the body. So the meaning of these two 
terrns should be taken with reference to the context.

The increase and decrease ( of the do~as and dhatus) have to be understood by 
the decrease and increase of their opposite properties respectively; the increase and 
decrease of the malas (wastes) by their excess accumulation or excess elimination 
respectively~ of these two, it is the decrease of the malas that troubles the body 
more, since the body is not accustomed to it.

Va.ta resides in the asthi (bone tissue), Pitta in asrk (blood) and sveda (sweat) 
and Kapha in the rest (of the dhatus and malas); therefore. the cause of increase and 
decrease of both ( Dosha and dhatu) is one and the same: but it is not so in the case 
of Asthi and Va.ta. 
The increase of all (the dhatiis) being generally due to overnutrition, Kapha is 
seen predominant in such conditions; in the opposite condition ( decrease of dhatus) 
it is Vata which' is predominant. Hence, the disorders caused by the increase and 
decrease are to be treated with Lailghana (decrease or nutrition) and B:pnhai:ia 
(increase of n1itrition) therapies respectively. In case or Vata it_ should be both 
B pimai:ia and Lailghana. 
In all cases, the use of substahccs, qualities and actions either opposite or 
similar but not antagonistic (to the dhatus) is to be planned appropriately. ( 8) 
Notes : The relationship that exists normally in the body between the do:y(ts und 
dhatus has been explained above. The dhiitus (tissue) and maliis (wastes) are the a.fraya 
( recepticle, container, place of residence) and the do~iis are iisra_vi ( content, material, 
present inside). Vata resides in the bone tissue, Pitta in blood and Kapha in the remaining 
i.e., rasa, mafnsa, medas, majja, sukra and purz~a. Dhiitus undergo increase or decrease 
by the same causes except in the case ofviitaand asthi. The theory behind the relationship 
between asthi and Vata has not been understood clearlysofar. None of the commentators 
have elaborated (Jll this point and no satisfactiory explanation is available till date. 
In the treatment rd' ailrnents caused by the increase of the dhiitus, the drugs or 
rnethrids selecud should be opposite to the dhiitus either materially, qualitatively or 
DO$ADI VIJNANiYA ADHYAYA 
fimctionally. Likelvise, ailments caused by the decrease of the dhiitus should be treated 
with druxs or methods which are similar either materially, qualitatively or functionally. 
A caution has also been given, that the drug or method so selected should not be the one 
lrhich destrovs the dhiitus.

The dhatiis of the body generally undergo vrddhi (increase) by the use of foods 
and activities which are similar materially or which possess similar propertie~ 
predominantly; they undergo decrease by the use of foods and activities which are 
opposite materially or which possess opposite properties predominantly. The 
dhatus which are heavy undergo increase by substances which possess the property 
of heaviness; and those which cause union or compactness; and decrease by those 
·Nhich cause seperation or rarefaction. Hence (~n this analogy) even inspite of 
many other substaces, rakta (blood) undergoes increase especially by the use of 
hi nod as food, marhsa (muscle) by the ingestion of meat, medas (fat) by the use of 
fat as food, asthi (bone) by the use of cartilages as food, majja (marrow) by the use 
ur marrow as food, sukra (reproductive tissue) by use of seminal fluid; garbha 
( I octus) by the use of egg as food. 
The substances thus mentioned possessing similar qualities, which could be 
u_sed as food or activities may not be present nearby, or, those which are present 
nearby may not be suitable to be used as food, being either antagonistic causing 
aversion, tastelessness or due to any other reason. In such circumstances, it is best 
to make use of substances of similar properties derived from different species 
(plants, animals or birds) possessing identical qualities predominantly. 
Chapter 19 
Notes: In this passage the term vrddhi (increase) is used as synonym of the term 
upacaya (normal growth) but not in the sense to denote abnormal growth as stated 
earlier. The various materials mentioned here are the tissues of the body either of man 
or animals. Tissues of the human body though present nearby are repulsive to be used 
as food. Hence, the advice, to make use of the tissues of animals and birds as food.

Even in respect of activities also, those which make for increase of the dhatus 
should be followed by persons who desire the increase of their dhatus should be 
followed by persons who desire the increase of their dhatus, and persons who desire 
the decrease of their dhatiis should follow activities which are dissimilar. 
Further, the ailn1ents caused by the abnormal increase of rakta (blood) should 
be treated specially by blood letting, purificatory therapies and purgations of the 
body; those of increase of marhsa (muscle) by purificatiory measures, surgical 
measures. use of alkalies and branding by fire; the ailn1ents of medas (fat) by 
adopting the treatment indicated rm: obesity and emaciation. 
Those (diseases) caused by decrease of rasa (plasn1a) by the use of meat soup,

prepared with drugs of bitter taste and those prepared with milk; ailments caused 
by increase or salqt (faeces) by adopting the treatment of diarrhoea: those caused

by decrease of faeces by the use of, yava, ma~a, kulma~a, ajame~amadhya 
(intestines of goat and ram); ailments caused by increase or decrease of mfitra 
(urine) by adopting treatment of diabetes and dysurea respectively; those due to 
decrease of sveda (sweet) by oil-bath, exercises, wines, sleep, remaining in air­
tight room and other teachniques of producing perspiration. (10)

Listen further; another kind of increase and decrease of the dhatus occur due 
to the debility and intensity respectively of the moity of dhatvagni ( firelike agency) 
present within the dhatus. ( 11) 
4Hil.14sfQ c{lctl~fdfH{Sll.;a~~ Wi&l l~~ffl'd;aJXlqq~il.1~111~~11 
Just as a forest fire, though continuously burning, gets flared up greatly at 
certain times or gets-reduced at certain others, depending upon the nature of the fuel 
available, so also the continuity of dhatus undergo increase or decrease depending 
upon the nature of the fuel. (12) 
~~ fci4~1@ ~~~~~~I g~1~4'~f-1ctd ~~llil~J, !-4~iltd II~~ II 
Substances which are similiar (identical) or dissimilar (peculiar) to each of the 
dhatus are the causes for their quick increase or decrease respectively; because each 
one has its own specifi~ effect (action) in quickly transforn1ing them (dhatfis). (13) 
Notes : Just as there is Agni (fire-like activity) inside the alimentary tract to digest 
the food even so there is a specific kind of Agni (fire-like substance) in each of the dhatu. 
Its function is to digest the food material supplied to the dhaus through the constantly 
, circulating Rasa dhatu. This nutrient material is actually the essence of the food 
produced at the end of digestion in the alimenta,y tract. Depending upon the nature of 
this fire-like substance the dhii,tus undergo increase or decrese. lf thefire-like substance 
is very weak, the dkatus undergo abnonnal increase, dude to accumulation of large 
(Jlf(llltities of undigested food materials; if on the other hand, the fire-like substance is 
ve,~v strong, the dhatus undergo decrease due to quick consumption of nutrient available 
and non-availability qfextra nutrition. The nature of the food materials has also its own 
Chapter 19 
influence on the dhiitus. Materials which are identical or possess identical properties 
will have a sort of affinity ( congeneity, suitability) to the dhiitus. The use r?f' such foods 
will help for the upacaya of the dhiitus (normal growth of the tissues) quickly. Meat, in 
contrast to all other foods, specially helps for the normal growth rd' the rnuscles of the 
body quickly, because of its dose affinity. Such substances are said to l~e special and 
more suited than others. Materials which are not identical and possess properities 
opposite of those of the dhiitus, will cause their decrease. 
The preceding dhatii gives rise to (produces, generates) its succeeding dhatus~ 
similarly also, when they have undergone increase or decrease. ( 14a) 
Notes: Thefirst dhiitu Rasa will give rise to the production r?f its succeeding dhZitu 
the Rakta; Rakta in its trun produces Miirhsa, the next succeeding one. Miiri1sa produces 
Medas, Medas produces Asthi, Asthi produces Majjii and MaJja produces sukra. This 
order of succession is applicable both during normal as well as abnormal states. A dhiitu 
which has undergone increase will produce its succeeding dhiitu also in the state ,f 
increase, and that which has undergone decrease will produce its succeeding dhiitu also 
in the state c?f decrease.

The do~as undergoing vitiation (abnormality) will vitiate ( cause abnormalities)

The essence of all thedhatus is known as Paraojas; itis the very bcst(mate1ial), 
is soft, possesses the qualities of water, is pure, slightly reddish with yellowish 
tinge, it is the first essential element of the embryo, the essence of the rasa dhatu 
of the foetus and gets localised in its heart (of the foetus) very early (earlier to the 
formatin of the different parts of the body). 
It is the chief fluid material of the body on which life depends, by the absence 
or loss of which there is loss of life and by it the living beings arc kept happy. 
Even though residing in the heart, it is circulating every where and helps rhc 
life activities. It undergoes decrease by anger, hunger, worry, grief, physical 
ecertion, and other causes. By such decrease, the person begins to experience fear 
(of loss of life), debility, too much of worry, discomfort in the sense organs~ bad 
complexion, unstable mind (mental disturbances), dryness and emaciation of the 
body. The treatment for such condition is the use of rejuvinating drugs, milk, meat 
soup and others (which confer strength). 
Increase of ojas gives the body good growth, nourishment and improvement 
of strength. (29-34) 
Notes : Other treatises like, Caraka, and Susruta Sarhhitas and A~ta1iga hrdaya 
recognise two kinds of Ojas; ( a) para ojas which is of eight biiidu (minims), present in 
the heart, its increase providing the body with good development and strenxth. its 
decrease, causing loss of strength, complexion, soundness of the mind and sense orxa11s 
and its loss causing death. ( b) A para ojas which is of half anjali similar to that of Kap ha, 
circulates all over the body, along with rasa dhatu ( and rakta dhatu), confer the body 
with two kinds of strength viz., physical strength and strength to resist diseases (natural 
resistance). 
It has not been possible so far to identify correctly these two types of ojas and so 
it is a subjectfor ftirther research. 
DO$ADI VIJF/ANiYA ADHYAYA 
Do~a rak~alJLl (protecting the do~as) :

Foods which are hated (not liked) and those which are desired (wanted, liked) 
arc to be avoided or made us~ of, to mitigate or improve respectively, the do~as 
which are either increased or decreased, provided such foods are not harmful to the 
·body. (35) 
~~cJ'U fqqfkttiqM41: I~: ~B ~~~".J'ffil II~~ II 
The do~as which have undergone increase or decrease will produces in.the 
body desires (instincts) for foods of dissimilar and similar properties respectively; 
foolish persons do not recognise it (and attend to these). (36) 
~~~cJ'U~ fqd.cfd 1 ,(i\q1fu1 Ji~@~:~: ~cfili~ ll~\.911 
The do~as which have undergone increase will produce their symptoms 
depending upon their strength; the do~as which have undergone decrease will leave 
off (even) their own qualities/symptoms (will not bring up, unable to manifest) and 
the do~as which arc in their normal condition attend to their functions normally. (37)

The same do~as which in their normal state are the causes for the normalcy and 
growth() r the body, arc also the causes for destruction of the body in their abnormal 
state, -hence they should be prevented from undergoing decrease or increase by 
adopting healthy activities. (38) 
Notes: Tiu.) do~·as undergo abnormalities (increase or decrease) by indulgence in 
foods (l/1(/ activities lvhich are similar or dissimilar to ther properties. The body on its 
own occonl. trie to bring back the do~as to their normal condition by indicating some 
instincts -df!sires or aversions to foods, activities; the do~as which have undergone

Chapter 19 
which have undergone decrease. By attending to these desires and aversions, the do~as 
can be normalised even without recourse to drugs. 
The do~as which have undergone increase, produce mild, moderate or severe 
symptoms depending upon the degree of their strength. The do~as which have undergone 
decrease will have become very weak in their own natural qualities and so will not be 
able to produce distressing symptoms or if at all, might give rise to a few mild symptoms. _ 
This is the reason for the catergorial statement ''that diseases are produced by the 
increased do~as ".

Vata (Vata) is formed out of (born form the combination of) Vata and akasa 
bhutas; Pitta from agni (tejas) bhuta; Kapha from ap and prthvi bhutas; 
Do~a sthii.na ( seats of the do~ii.s) : 
. . . 
Pakvasaya (large intestine), waist, thighs, feet, bones, ears and the skin are the 
seats ofVata, specially so thepakvasaya. Umbilicus, amasaya (stomach and small· 
intestines), sweat, lymph, blood, eyes and the skin are the seats of Pitta, specially 
so the (region of) the umbilicus: Chest, throat, head, kloma (pancreas) joints, 
amasaya, rasa (plasma), fat, nose, tongue are the seats of Kapha, specially so the 
' chest. 
Thus the body is supported by these three do~as situated inthe lower, middle 
and upper portions respectively, just like a house is supported firmly by three 
pillars. Since the do~as maintain the firmness of the body·they are called as pillars, 
they are (also) called as dhatiis because they support the body and as malas because 
Chapter20 
they pollute (vitiate) the body and also because they are the waste products of the 
food; they are called as do~as because of their tendency of polluting ( causing 
abnormalities) others (1).

Each one of them (do~as) are again of five kinds (divisions) such as Pral).a, 
Udana Vyana, Samana and Apana of Vata; of these -
P aiica Vata (five div isons of Vata) : 
Pral).a is located in the head, moves downwards to the throat and chest; attends 
to the functions of maintenance of intellect, sense organs, heart, mind, and arteries 
(veins also); functions such as expectoration, sneezing, belching, inspiration, 
expiration, swallowing of food and such others. 
Udana located in the chest, moves in the region of the throat, nose and 
umbilicus, attends to the functions of producing speech, activities (physical 
movements, actions) valour, strength, col?ur; nourishing the tissue pores (by 
providing them nutrition); discrimination, courage, memory, awakening of the 
mind and such others. 
Vyana located in the heart, moves all over the body with great speed, attends 
to functions such as movement (locomotion), expansion, contraction, upward 
movement, downward movement, opening and closing of the eyelids, yawning,

DO!jABHEDlYA ADHYAYA 
feeling the·tastes of food, clearing ( or cleansing or widening) of the channels ( or 
pores), causing the flow of sweat and blood, bringing the male reproductive tissue 
( semen vis a vis spermatozo) into the uterus, separating the nutrient portion and 
waste portion of the food ( after its digestion) and supplying nourishment to all the 
dhatus in proper order. 
Samana located near to the digestive fire (in the stomach) kindles it, moves 
inside the large intestine, stomach and small intestines, channels of the do~as, 
malas (wastes) sukra(reproductivetissueofthemale), artava(menstrualfluid, and 
also ovum, the reproductive tissue of the female), and ambu (body fluids); supports 
rhem in their functions, attends to functions such as ret~ining of food, (in the 
alimentary tract), digestion, separation_of essence and wastes and moving the waste 
products downwards and such other functions. 
• Apana located in the rectum, moves along the urinary bladder, pelvis, penis, 
scrotum (testes) and groin, attends to elimination of faeces, urine, semen, menstrual 
fluid and foetus and such other functions (2).

Pacaka, Rafi.jaka, Sadhaka, Alocaka and Bhrajaka are the divisions of Pitta : 
That Pitta which resides in between the amasaya (stomach) and pakvasaya 
(largeintestine ); though composed of all the five bhiitas, yet has the predominance 
of qualities of tejas bhuta and deficiency of qualities of apbhiita. Hence, it is devoid 
of the qualities (properties) of liquids. Helped by exciting (helping, cooperating)

Chapter 20 
causes such as Vata, moisture (water) and others, it attends to the functions such as 
burning and digestion, so obtains the name Agni (fire); it digests the food, separates 
the essence and wastes from it; remaining in its own place it supports (gives he~p) 
the other pittas, located in different places. Thi~ Pitta is known as Pacaka. 
Notes : Pacaka Pitta described as residing in between amasaya and pak wasaya 
should be taken to mean as residing i11:side these organs. Though it is actually existing 
in the from of liquid, it does not possesses the qualities of ( sneha) moisture and ( saitya) 
coldness which are the special qualities of liquids generally; it requires the help of other 
factors to carry on its functions. It supports the other pittas and also dhatwagnis ( similar 
substances present in the tissues). 
The Pitta, located in the amasaya (stomach) is known as Rafijak:a as it imparts 
red colour to rasa (plasma). 
The Pitta located in the heart is known as Sadhaka, because it helps achieve 
the aims of life, by attending to functions such as discrimination, intelligence, pride 
and enthusiasm. 
The Pitta which is found in the eyes is known as Alocak:a, because it helps 
seeing. 
, That whicfris'located in the skin is known as Bhrajaka; for it helps expression 
of colour., It digests the materials used in the form of oil-massage, water-bath, 
application of paste, · (poultices linaments) over the • skin and reflects the 
complexon. (3) -

That Kapha which resides in the chest, helps the areas aruond the shoulders, 
arms and neck by its own capacity, helps the heart by the capacity of the essence 
off ood; remaining in its own place supports the other kaphas by contributing the 
properties of water, is known as Avalambaka, because of its supporting functions. 
The Kapha which resides in the amasaya ( stomach) is known as Kledaka, since 
it moistens the solid food. 
That which is located in the tongue and helping in appreciation of tastes is 
called as Bodhak:a. 
That which resides in the head and nourishes the sense organs is called as 
Tarpaka. 
. ' That which resides in the joints providing lubrication to the bones is called as 
Sle~ak:a. ( 4)

In this n1anner, the do~as, though present all over the body, are also found 
abundantly in certain places when they are normal. 
, The causes which bring about·their increase will.be described in the NiQana 
section. In the previous chapter., the symptoms caused by their increase and 
decrease generally, have already been described. 
Dvivi<f:ha Vrddhi (two kinds of increase) : 
Vrddhi (increase of do~as) is of two kindsviz. caya and prak:opa; riik~a 
( dryness and other qualities ( of Vata), associated with u~i;ia (heat) bring about Vata 
saficaya; associated with sita ( cold) they cause Vata Prakopa; snigdha (unctousness) 
Chapter 20 
and other qualities associated with U~Qa (heat) bring about Vata Pra~ama 
(mitigation). Tik~t:ia (penetrating) and other qualities of Pitta) associated with sita 
( cold) cause Pitta safi.caya, associated with U~Qa (heat) cause Pitta prakopa; manda 
(slowness) and others associated with sita (cold) will cause Kapha saficyya, 
associated with U~Qa (heat) cause Kapha prakopa; riilqa (dryness) and others 
associated with u~t:ia (heat) will cause Kapha prasama. (15)

Caya (safi.caya) in defined as "in~rease (of the do~a) in its own seats (places); 
such a condition produces a:version to the factors which were the causes of increase 
and desire for factors which have the qualities opposite of those of the do~a. 
Kopa (Prakopa) is movement of the increased do~a even to the seats (places) 
of other do~as; such a condition causes manifestation of its own abnormal • 
symptoms, loss of health, and occurance of diseases. 
Sarria (Prasama) is presence of the do~as in their normal condition, in their own 
place without giving rise to diseases. 
Just as the clouds are brought together at one place by the wind (and made to 
rain) the do~as which have undergone increase are made to produce diseases either 
in the whole body, in half of it or in any one organ, being brought there by the 
influense of Vata. (6-8)

Feeling of heaviness of the abdomen causing lack of desire for food is qpti, 
others say that twti is lack of desire for food and drinks or loss of appetite 
(anorexia); inability of perception as though engrossed in sleep is tandra; others say 
that staimitya is pramilaka ( deep sleep) or unconsciousness); upalepa is feeling of 
being covered with a pasteor smeared with greasy material; excessive fullness or 
smeared with gresay material is praticaya; saitya is profound decrease of body 
temperature; udarda is accumulation of fluid in the chest, according to some others, 
udarda is shivering associated with cold (rigors), still other say that udarda is 
swelling, red in colour with itching seen specially in cold season from contact with 
cold water and produced by Kapha. ( 12-13) 
So far only major diseases were mentioned. Minor diseases are named with 
the prefix of the name of the organ which they affect, for example, nakhabheda, 
snkhabheda, lalatabheda, antardaha, kanthopalepa, hrda yopalepa etc., the features 
of su,ch diseases are described in that manner. (13-14)

In all such diseases which are not mentioned here which are innumerable, the 
features of the do~as only are seen manifesting all over the body without any 
exception. So their ( do~as) functions and methods of treatment are all the same. The 
features ( qualities and properties) specific to each of t;he do~as have already been 
described in Ayu~kamiya (chapter 1). (15)

DO$ABHED1YA ADHYAYA 
The functions of Vata which has undergone vrddhi (increase, aggravation) 
are causing drooping, expansion, obstruction, and weakness of the bodyparts, 
tearing pain, pricking pain, horripilations, thirst, hardening, squeezing pain all over 
the body, termors, misery ( dull discomfort), constricting pain, breaking pain, 
continuous pain; dryness ( evaporation), loss of sensation, brittleness, hallowness, 
contractions, throbbing of the body parts; astringent taste in the mouth and blackish 
red discolouration. 
Vrddha Pitta karma (functions of increased Pitta) : 
The functions of (increased) Pitta are: causing of burning sensation, increase 
of boty temperature, formation of ulcers, excess perspiration, increase of moisture 
(by excess secretions), putrifaction ( decomposition), exudation, redness, pungent 
and sour taste in the mouth and appearance of other colours except white and 
cnmson. 
Vrddha Kapha karma (functions of increased Kapha): 
Functions of increased Kapha are: causing itching, immobility, heaviness, 
accumulation of waste products forming coating inside the channels and organs, 
increase of moisture (unctuosness), coldness, obstruction, slowing of actions, 
sweet and salt taste in the mouth and whitish discolouration. (16)

Kapilabala has correlated these special symptoms with the taste (perception); 
he says ''Pitta which has increased produces pungent, sour and salt tates (in the 
mouth), Kapha which has increased causes sweet, sour and salt tastes and Va.ta 
undergoing increase will produce astringent, bitter and pungent tastes; by (noting) 
these tastes the increase of the connected do~a is to be inferred'' 
AS48 377 

Chapter 20 
Susruta states further; Pitta in its vidagdha state ( digestive phase) becomes 
sour and Kapha becomes salty. 
.. 
In this way the specific properties (qualities) and functions of Vata and other 
do~as are to be determined by the help of the scriptures (medical texts), personal 
observation and inferences. Later correlating such a determination with habitat, 
time, quantity etc., treatment ( of the increased do~a) should be started immediately.

Further on will be described th~ classification of the do~as in respect of their 
increase and decrease; they are of three kinds from the increase of each do~a 
individually; from the combination of two do~as undergoing increase they are three 
and thus make a total of nine altogether; from the normalcy of one 1o~a (and 
increase of other two) it will be three; and six altogether from the increase of one 
do~a more than the other two. One group from the increase of all the three do~as 
increased together; all these together form thirteen; from the combination of two 
do~as which have undergone increase more than the remaining one, it wiH,be six; 
one from the combination of all the three undergoing increase; from the greater or 
lesser degree of increase it will be six. In this man11er there will be twentyfive 
combinations of do~as in respect of their increase. An equal number will be in 
respect of their decrease.. Again it will be six more from the combinations of 
increase of one, decrease of one and normalcy of o,ne do~a; it. will be six more from 
the combination of decrecase of one Dosha and increase of the other two; thus there 
' . . , • .

are sixtytwo; the sixtythird is the one responsible for maintenance of health ( all the 
three do~as being in their normal condition). (19-23)

During the course of diseases, the following six types of increase, decrease and 
nonnalcy of the do~as which are very difficult to determine are described 
hereunder. 
Vata which has undergone increase when Kapha undergoes decrease, expels 
the normal Pitta from its places to other places of the body producing tearing pain, 
burning sensation, loss of strength and fatigue in those places. 
Vata which has undergone increase when Pitta undergoes decrease, expels the 
normal Kapha from its places to other places in the body, producing constant pain, 
coldness, stiffness (loss of movement) and feeling of heaviness in them. 
When Pitta has undergone increase and Kapha undergoes decrease, Vata which 
is in normal condition blocks the movement of Pitta producing burning sensation 
and constant pain. 
When Kapha is normal, Pitta is increased; and Vata decreased; the increased 
Pitta produces fever associatd with stupor and feeling of heaviness of the body. 
Chapter20 
When Vata is normal, Pitta is increased and Kapha decreased, l:4ere will_ be 
chills, heaviness and pain. 
When the Pitta is normal, Kapha is increased and Vata decreased, there will be 
dyspepsia, pain in the head, sleep, stupor, coating (of the channels) diseases of the 
heart, heaviness of te body, expectoration of . Pitta and Kapha and yellow 
discolouration of the nails and other parts. (23-31)

The symptoms of increase and decrease of the do~as which have been describd 
separately above, should be anticipated in other cases also. (32)

The symptoms that manifest as a result of increase and decrease of do~as, their 
combination with rasa, rakta and others ( dhatus and malas) both in their normal and 
abnormal conditions and in greater and lesser degree, will be endless (innumerable), 
and can be understood only with a mind intent on it. (33).

The treatments for Kapha ( which has undergone increase) are : strong 
purificatory therapies ( emesis and purgation) with drugs possessing dryness, 
pungent, bitter and astringent tastes, use of foods possessing the same properties; 
use of wines which are strong, old and pleasant; activities such as running,jumping, 
swimming, keeping awake without sleep, fighting with arm, fighting with weapons, 
sxual intercpurse, physical exercises, dry massage, bath and application of dry 
powders to the body. 
Honey, soups of grains or pulses, emesis, fasting, inhalation of smoke, mouth 
gargles, avoidance of comfort and regimen prescribed for vasanta (spring) are all 
to be observed especially for benefit. (3) 
In conditions of combination of two Dosha or of all the three Dosha, the . '. . 
remedealmeasures suggested for each do~a separately may be combined judiciously 
as found suitable. ( 4)

If Vata and Pitta have combined together the regimen is like that gri~ma 
(summer); if Kapha and Vata it is like that of vasanta (spring) because Vata is 
yogavahi (ambivalent); in case of Kapha and Pitta combination, the regimen is that

In Gri~ma, Vata undergoes only caya (mild increase) because the food 
materials that are used then, possess lightness (easily digestible) and dryness and 
DO~APAKRMJYAIYA ADHYAYA 
the same condition exists inside the body also. It does not undergo Prakopa 
(profound increas~. because of the heat of the season. 
In V ar~a, Pitta undergoes only caya (mild increase) because the food substances 
that are used then, possess more moisture and become sour at the end of digestion 
and similar condition exists inside the body also. It does not undergo prakopa 
(profound increase )I because of the cold of the season. 
In Sisira, Kapha undergoes cay a by the use of food substances which are 
unctuos, cold potency and full of water, similar will be the condition inside the 
body. It will only become solidified by the effect of the season but does not undergo 
prakopa. Thus are the nature of the seasons. (9-11)

The do~as undergo caya and other states either suddenly or slowly ( after some 
time) by the effect of foods and activities, irrespective of the season, andnotmerely 
by the effect of the season. 
Do~as which have increased profoundly invade the entire body from the feet 
to the head, very quickly butreceedevery slowly, little bylittle,justlik:e the clouds 
in the sky. (12-13) 
Notes: Accumulation of rain bearing clouds in the sky is very quick and causes rain 
over a wide area. If it does not rain due to some reason, the clouds do not vanish quickly 
but move away slowly after a long time. Similarly the do~o,s, do not return to normal 
quickly.

Chapter21 
Do~as are to be controlled (brought back to normal) during the stage of caya 
(mild increase) itself. If it has reached the prakopa stage (profound increase) the 
treatment for the increased do~a should not interfere with the othe~ do~as (which 
are normal). If there is prakopa of all the three do~as, which ever is more powerful 
should be treated first without interfering with the others. If all are of equal strength, 
treatment should be for Vata first, next to Pitta and last to Kapha, because that is the 
order of strength of the do~as in the body naturally. 
Even Parasara also has substantiated this statement with an illustration 
stating, that by the fall of the commander, the . army gets defeated quickly and 
easily. (14-17) 
Notes : Among the do~as, Vata is very powe,ful, quick in action, causing many 
ailments to the body by its own inherent capacity. Pitta is next inferior in strength, 
quickness of action and causation of ailments. Kapha is still inferior in strength, very 
slow in action and in causation of ailments, Pitta and Kapha often require the help ofVata 
to act. SoVata is considered as the leader or commander of do~as. In conditions wherein 
all the three have undergone increase, ifvata is brought to normal by treatment, the other 
two do~as may become normal even without treatment or with very simple treatments.

Some authorities give importance to the site (of accumulaiton of increased 
do~a) and say that Kapha is to be controlled first. If Kapha accumulates in the head, 
chest and throatwhereis the possibility of taste of food?, in such an absence, how 
is it possible to use foods, drinks or drugs? .If there is no ingestion of food where 
is the possibility of controlling the do~as? So, Kapha is to be controlled first, because 
it remains as a_ bolt at the door of the body. Pitta is to be treated next, for it resides 
DO$APAKRMJYAiYA ADHYAYA , 
in the centre ( of the body), is considered as acting swiftly being a freind of Vata; 
Vata is to be treated in the last. 
Yet others say that treatment should start first with Pitta and end with Kapha.

Susruta opines that -the above method i's not appropriate untf ormly (in all 
diseases). In cases of jvara (fever) and atisara (diarrhoea) the order of treatment 
should be first for Pitta, next Kapha and last for Vata; in fever, the heat and 
consequent discomfort, point to predominance of tejas (Pitta); likewise in diarrhoea, 
the elimination of feces is due to Pitta predominance, so also the loose bowel 
movements. In both the diseases Kapha is next inferior in strength and causes 
feeling of heaviness, indigestion and lassitude. Vata also undergoes increase 
during day time, inevitably because of the decrease of these two ( do~as ). Hence in 
fever and diarrhoea this is the method of treatment for the do~as. (22-25)

Some others say, that the treatment should be for Kapha, Pitta and Vata in 
succession; beacuse the increase of do~as are produced chiefly in the stomach by 
its excitation. That do~a which has undergone increase in its own seat is quick to 
act (to produce diseases), hence it should be controlled first by treatment. (26-27)

Taking into consideration the strength of the increased do~as by their actions, 
appropriate treatment are to be done and not by sticking on rigidly to the advise of 
the texts. (28) 
Chapter21 
A treatment is not ideal, if it cures one disease and causes the increase of 
another disease at one and the same time; ideal treatment is that, which cures a 
disease but not excite another. (29)

Two do~as which are weak are not enough to overcome ( cause decrease) one 
do~a which has undergone increase. In condition of combination of equal strength 
of all the three do~as, one does not subjugate the other because of inherent 
properties of do~as. Coldness, liquidity, sourness, saltiness, pungency and other 
qualities are common to more then one do~a, even then one do~a does not destroy 
the other. 
In the combination of do~as which are of opposite qualities, the same 
condition seen in the things of the universe having the three (great) qualities (co­
existing together peacefully is also seen) so also in diseases produced by the three 
do~as. (30-32) 
Notes : Two kinds of combination of do~iis can be possible; first one, that of do~ii 
possessing similar qualities eg. Viita and Kapha; the second one, that of do~a does 
possessing opposite qualities eg, Kapha·and Pitta. In ~oth the cases, one do~ii does not 
cause either increase or decrease of the other do~ii. This is due to sahaja siitmya ( a 
natural inherent immunity) present in the body which protects the body both during 
normal and abnormal conditions. The simile of the three qualities -Satwa, Rajas and 
Tamas -makes the point clear. Each of these three is oppoisite of the other they are 
present in every substance of this universe, they function without hindering one another.

The first dhatu -the Rasa -which has been inadequately digested (improperly 
processed) due. to the weakness of the digestive fire and accumulating in the 
stomach ( and intestines) (in the abnormal state) is known as Arna. 
Others say that Arna is also produced by the combination of do~as among 
themselves, which have undergone abnormal increase, just as poison is produced 
from kodrava grain. (36-37)

Notes: The ingestedfood udergoes transformation ( digestion) inside the alimentary 
tract by the agency of ko~thiigni ( digestive fire) vis a vis Piicaka Pitta ( digestive juices 
havingfirelike activity). At the end of digestion, AhiiraRasa(the essenceofthefo_od) gets 
separated. It undergoes further processing and gets transformed as Rasa dhiitu -thefirst 
liquid tissue of the body. Whe~ the ko~thiigni ( digestive functions vis a vis the juices) are 
normal ( in their quantity and qualities) the Rasa dhiitu will be properly formed 
adequately processed. This is what happens during health. If on the other hand the 
kosthiigni is poor ( in quantity, and quality) all the food materials are not digested 
adequateiy and properly. As such, undigested ( iima) materials accumulate and the Rasa 
dhiitu that gets formed will be having less or more of these undigested materials. These 
materials act as poison ( iimavi~a -endotoxins) to the body. When the Rasa dhiitu 
circulates all over the body in its normal routine, these poisonous materials are purveyed 
to all the parts of the body. They stagnate in some places and give rise to the onset of 
diseases there. The do~iis which are also circulating along with Rasa dhiitu gets mixed 
with these undigested materials, there~y becoming siima do~a ( mixed with iima materials).

Attempt should not be made to eliminate ( suddenly by force) the Sama do~as 
which are circulating all over the body, which are accumulating in the tissues and 
which have not become excited to move out the body. Such an attempt willbe like 
talcing out the juice from an unripe fruit, it will cause destruction of the body itself, 
as these materials are removable with great difficult. So they should be expelled 
DO$APAKRM"fYAJYA ADHYAYA 
' out of the body after administration of therapies such as digestives, appetisers, 
oleation (lubrication) and sudation and finally by purificatory measures (emesis 
and purgation), in accordace with the location and strength of such materials 
(do~as). 
Those (do~as) which have accumulated in the amasaya (stomach and small 
intestine) should be expelled through the mouth, that accumulating in the head 
through the nose and that accumulating in the pakvasaya (large intestine) through 
the rectum. 
Attempt should not also be made to stop the movement of Arna out of the body 
which has started of its own accord, by administration of drugs and therapies. By 
such with holding, they create conditions suitable for origin of diseases such as 
obesity etc. enumerated in Roganutpadaruya (Chapter 5). 
So ( the physician) desirous of health ( of the patient), should be negligent of 
the Dosha which have started moving out of the hody of their own accord , at their 
commencement, digest them which have stagnated deep inside by administration 
of drugs and expel them out later on. (39-44)

Chapter 22 
Diseases are of seven kinds; such as, Sahaja, Garbhaja, Jataja, Pidaja, Kalaja, 
Prabhavaja and Svabhavaja; each one is of two kinds. 
Sahaja (born with, inherited, heriditary) are due to abnormalities of Sukra 
(male seed) and arthava (female seed). For example, leprosy (and other skin 
diseases), haemorrhoids, diabetes etc. They are (of two kinds) : ( a) pitrja (paternal) 
and (b) matrja (maternal). 
• Grabhaja ( congenital) are those caused by the improper activities of the 
mother, such as hunchback, lameness, brown (tawny) eyes (cornea), leucoderma 
and other due to (a) Annarasaja (food) and (b) due to douhrda vimananaja (not 
satisfying the longings of the pregnant woman). 
Jataja (acquired) are those caused by ones own improper food; (a) santarpai:iaja 
(by over-nourishment/ over-feeding) and (b) by apatarpai:iaja (undernourishment 
underfeeding). 
Pidaja (traumatic) are those caused by injury from weapons like wounds, 
fractures, blows, anger, grief, fear, etc. (a) sarfra (somatic) and (b) manasika 
(psychic/ mental). 
Kalaja (seasonal, climatic) caused by cold, heat etc., such as fevers and other 
diseases. They are due to (a) Vyapannja (abnormal nature of seasons) and (b) 
asamraksai:iaja (inadequate or no protection). 
Prabhavaja (influcncial, providential) caused by (a) curse of gods and godly 
men, violation of tradition, Atharvanic rites (sorcery, witchcraft) such as fevers and 
(b) possession by pisaca (goblins) and other evil spirits. 
Svabhavaja (natural) such as hunger, thirst, oldage etc., either of (a) kalaja 
(appropriate time) or (b) akalaja ( of inappropriate time, premature); those of proper 
time are produced even after protection (care) whereas that of improper time 
(premature) arc due to lack of protection (carelessness). 
All the above diseases arc again of two kinds viz. (a) pratyutpannakarmaja­
thosc caused by activities ·of the present life and (b) piirva karmaja-those caused 
395, 

ROGABHEDIYA ADHYAYA 
by activities of the previous lives. Activities of the present life are either seen or 
unseen (known or unknown), either in the form of not following the regimen 
prescribd by the learned or indulging in activities contrary to the ones prescribed. 
Activities of the past lives, previously named as Daiva, (in chapter 9) is of two 
kinds-de-finite (specific, special) and indefinite (unspecific, casual, general). 
Hence, all seen (known or understood) causes are those of the present life; the 
opposite (unseen causes) are those of Daiva providential, divine) origin; those 
causes which are trivial (mild, insignificant, weak) in nature but cause dreadful 
diseases-are a mixture of both (activities of the present life and past lives). (1) 
The diseases due to actions of the present life will get relieved by the use of 
opposite (foods, drugs or activities possessing qualities or effects opposite of the/ 
do~as or diseases). The diseases caused by providence (actions of past lives) will 
be relieved only after the effect of such actions comes to an end, inspite of the use 
of opposites. The rest by the diminition of both the effects. 
Some other authorities describe the action of the present life as : ( the effect of) 
actions of others, which is also known as parabhisarhskara (developed or conceived 
by others). They argue that if all the effects are accepted as due to ones own action, 
then there will be nothing like effects of actions of enemies at all. Why should a 
person though a scholar do n1any acts to please another person and get benefit and 
happiness from him or displease him by his acts and get evils and misery from him? 
Diseases though of two kinds broadly, as above, are in fact, of three kinds and 
further those caused by the do~as are of seven kinds. (2) 
Notes: Pariibhisarhskara literally means concieved or developed by others and 
refers to evil acts such as sorcery, witchcraft etc., which were ver,.i common in ancient 
times. Persons though scrupulous in their food and activities still became victims of 
diseases by the effect of such evil acts developed and transferrd by the enemies. So even 
such harmful acts of others should be taken as causes of diseases and included under 
activities of the present life. So the cause of diseases become three, viz., acts of previous 
lives, ones own acts of the present life and acts of others during the present life. All these 
diseases are again due to the distrubances in the do~as only are counted as seven; viz., 
Chapter 22 
three by each one of the three do~iis separately, three by the combination of any two do~iis 
and one from the combination of all the three do~iis together.

All these categories of diseases are amenable for treatment and so have been 
enunciated within the tenets of A yurveda. Even though diseases have a definite 
(known) cause and can be cured by the removal of that cause still they can be to 
lerated ( without much suffering) by fallowing the advise of the physician, till the 
period of ones life comes to an end. By not following such advices, life may end 
up prematurely. Though some diseases get cured automatically, either due to being 
born of trivial causes or by the effect of providence, they can get cured more quickly 
and without any difficulty, if they get the support of the sixteen good qualities of 
therapeutics. Though the effects of providence (action of past lives) are of 
indefinite nature, the diseases do not get any chance at all, to develop in persons 
who follow the regimem of healthy living. So a wise man should not, at any stage, 
consider the healthy and unhealthy things as similar (as of one and the same effect) 
Furth~r, the diseases are again of three kinds-the mild, the moderate and the 
severe; those which have very few symptoms are mild, those having moderate 
number of symptoms are moderate and those which develop all the symptoms fully 
are severe. They (diseases) are also of four kinds such as easily curable etc. as 
described earlier {in chapter 3). (3) 
Notes : All diseases are to be treated by one or other method; Ayurveda has 
ROGABHEDiYA ADHYAYA 
enunciated, all such methods, and so following the advise of this science is absolutely 
necessary. Though it is seen that some diseases get cured on their own accord without 
any treatment, it does not happen in all diseases always. Diseases can be either 
prevented, or can be tole rated without much suffering, if good treatment is available. The 
sixteen qualities of treatment are the ideal qualities of the four limbs of treatment: the 
physician, drug, attendant and the patient.

Though of many such categories, they (diseases) will not be apart from 
being either Nija (organic, endogenous, internal) or Agantu (traumatic, 
exogenous, external). Nija diseases (organic) are of do~as which become ab­
normal first and painful symptoms develop later. Agantu diseases (traumatic) 
are due to external causes: in them the painful symptoms develop first due to 
assult (blow) etc. and the do~as become abnormal later. Different kinds of 
diseases manifest and also increase due to abnormalities of the do~as. So there 
is no disease without abnormal do~as. The only difference being its presence 
either in the beginning or later. Hence all the diseases are of one kind only 
because of pain (misery, unhappiness) being common in all. They become 
innumerable depending upon the causes, location, features, colour, nomencla­
ture, suffering (feelings), effect, and mode of treatment. These will be de­
scribed in brief at appropriate places, as they are innumerable and are to be 
tryated depending only upon the symptoms produced by the do~as. (4)

Chapter 22 
Do~as alone are the causes for ~11 diseases. just as a bird which flies all over 
the place throughout the day and still cannot be without its shadow or just as all the 
myriads of things in the universe cannot be without the effects of the three gui:ias 
(satwa, rajas and tamas), so also, all the diseases canot be without the three do~as. 
Just as the thunderbolt, rain etc., occur in the sky, but not without a powerful 
cause (in other words only with a powerful or essential cause) or just as waves, 
bubbles etc. occur in water ( of the sea), so also the diseases ( occur only with 
abnormal) do~a. (5) 
Notes : Ayu-rveda gives primacy only to the do~iis among the different causes of 
disease. There can be no disease without abnormal do~iis. The exmpale of thunderbolt, 
rain, waves, bubbles etc., is to indicate the relationship between the cause and effect. 
Thunderbolt and others manifest from the sky but do not happen at all times. Another 
important cause is necessary to produce them and that is the wind. This wind becomes 
the efficient cause. Only when the wind becomesvery active and brings the accumulation 
of clouds, there will be thunderbolt and rain. This analogy _as applied to 
diseasemanif estation can be explaind thus; diseases arise in the dhiitus (tissues) of the 
body; they manifest only when the abnormal do~iis vitiate the dhiitus. So,for the disease, 
the do~iis are Nimitta kiira1J,a ( Powerful and efficient cause), the dhiitus are 
SamaviiyikiiralJ,a (inherent cause), the various foods and activities which bring about 
abnormality of the do~iis are sahiikari kiira1J,as, exciting, helpful, supportive causes.

Asatmyendriartha samyoga-improper correlation of sense organs with their objects, 
ROGABHEDIYA ADHYAYA 
(b) Prajfiaparadha-willful transgression of modes of conduct and (c) Parii:iama­
change(time, season); eachofthemisagain of three kinds; viz., atiyoga(excessive), 
ayoga (inadequate) and mithyayoga (perverse); just as seeing objects for a very 
longtime, is excess use of the organ of seeing; similarly for the other sense organs 
with their objects is atiyoga (excessive correlation); seeing objects for a very short 
time or not using the eye at all for seeing is a.yoga (inadequate or abs~nce of 
correlation; (similarly for the other sense organs). Seeing objecs which are small, 
very far away, very near, unsteady, very bright, terrific, unpleasant and unnatural; 
hearing sounds which are hated ( disliked) very loud, very rough and very fearful; 
smells such as putifying ( decomposing) foul, very penetrating, very acute (powerful 
intense, strong) and repelling; ingestion of foods which are not having the natural 
taste, not prepared properly and those which are not suitable for health improper 
indulgence in bathing (massaging and other acts), use of cold and heat, improper 
way to touching, holding etc., of objects, touching thing which are dirty (impure), 
assault by other living beings (big or minute), injury, poisonous air (gas) etc., all 
these are mithyayoga (perverse correlation) of the senses (respectively)

All the three kinds of unhealthy actions-those of the body, speech and mind­
constitute Prajfiaparadha (willful transgresion). Too much of indulgence in such 
action is excessive activity; very little or no indulgence at all, is inadequate activity;. 
untimely initiation of .the bodily urges, withholding them when not to, unnatural 
postures and movements; falling, scratching, beating, controlling the breath and 
such other activities of the body; speaking while hungry, while thirsty and in the 
middle of eating and such other action of speech; emotions like fear, grief, greed, 
jealosy, and the ten sinful acts all these constitue perverse activities of the body, 
speech and mind respectively (6). 
Chapter22 
Notes : The ten sinful acts are hirhsa (torture), steya (stealing) anyathakama 
(unlawful sex), paisunya ( columny, backbiting, slanderous speech)Parusa vacaiia(harsh, 
abusive speech) anrtavacana (falsehood, untrue speech) sambhinnalpa (irrelevant 
speech), vyapada (thinking of doing bad to others), abhidya (thinking of robbing away 
the property of others) drigviparyaya ( doubting, disbelieving or finding fault with the 
words of elders and scriptures).

Parii:iama (change) is known as time ( season), it is of three kinds, cold, hot and 
rainy; occurrence of these qualities in severe degree in the season is excess 
manifestation; occurrence in very mild degree is inadequate manifestation; 
occurrence of unusual features is perverse manifestation. 
All these three combination (associations, union)-excessive, inadequate and 
perverse -are all generally unsuited or harmful for health. All these, together 
known as Prajfiapara<lha are to be avoided. The proper combination of Artha 
(perceptions), Karma (activities) and Kala (seasons) being generally good lead to 
health. Among these, the artha (perceptions) except that of the taste, cause either 
bad or good to .their respective sense organs only; whereas taste perception, 
activities (of the body mind and speech) and the seasons ( cause harm or good) to 
the whole body (7).

ROGABHEDiYA ADHYAYA 
context of all the diseases, the Nidana (cause), do~as and the dfi~yas (dhatfis and 
malas) are the (causative) factors; the proper and improper combination of these 
are causes for differentiation of diseases; when these three factors either do not 
combine with one another, cobmine very little or loosely ( weak combination) then 
the diseases do not manifest, manifest after a long time or manifest midly with 
incomplete (very few) symptoms. The opposites (of their combination) produces 
the opposite effect. (8)

ROGABHEDiYA ADHYAYA 
These diseases man if est either as the chief one or as retinue ( associate, 
accompanying) of another disease; known respectively as Anubafidhya (leader, 
primary, chief) and Anubafidha (follower, secondary, associate, retinue). The 
f ormeris independent and has specific, well defined features ( signs and symptoms), 
cause and diagnosis; the latter is its opposite ( clinical features, causes and diagnosis 
being unsepecific and indefinite). Similarly also the do~as (are of two kinds, 
anubandhya and anubandha),. 
Diseases which are secondary are (again) of two kinds; Purogami (manifesting 
first) and Anugami (manifesting later); the former is known as piirvan1pa 
(premonitory/prodromal features) and the latter as upadrava (associate features, 
complications). These will have to be recognised in praticular contexts. They 
(secondry diseases) generally subside (disappear) with the cure of the primary 
diseases but when they do not subside they should be treated after the treatment of 
powerful ( and dangerous) they should be attended to immediately without opposing 
(provoking) the primary disease; because such complication cause severe troubles 
to the body which has become weak already by the disease, as seen in the case of 
diabetic carbuncles; 
Further, one pimary disease may become the primary (powerful) cause for 
another disease. For example, fever causes bleeding disease, or bleeding disease 
causes fever; both together may cause dyspnoea; splenic enlargement causes 
abdominal enlargement, which in turn may cause drospy; haemorrhoids may cause 
tumor ,and enargement of abdomen, diarrhoea and duodenal disease; nasal catarrh 
may cause cough and fevers, these two become the cause for consumption; 
consumption for emaciation etc, etc. 
One improper act (error, fault) might become the cause of one particular 
disease or of many diseases; likewise appearance of one symptom denotes any one 
particular disease and also many diseases; treatment of one disease may_ ~tigate 
it but might also (at the same tin1e) cause aggravation of the other diseases .. 
So, knowing all these, the physician should carefully examine. (determine) 
each one, in the light of the science and other methods. (10)

With the know ledge of the science, every disease is to be determined in respect 
of its exciting cause, cheif cause, location, features (symptoms) in respect of 
appearance (sight), sound, smell, taste and touch; prodromal symptoms, 
complications, aggravtion ( exacerbation) normalcy and mitigation, sequellae, 
specific nomenclature, the method to be adopted ( treatment) and not to be adopted 
for its cure. Such an examination being done with due intention. 
Rogi parik~a ( examination of the patient) 
Next, the patient is to be examined by Pratyak~a (sensory perception) through 
all the sense organs of the physician to determine the colour, shape, size, growth, 
shade, increase of the quality off eces, urine and vomitted material; gurgling noise 
of the intestines, crackling sounds in the joints such others; loss of tactile sensation, 
feeling of heat and cold, stiffness, throbbings, smoothness and coarseness of touch. 
The normal and abnormal taste in the mouth, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory bouts 
of vomitting, softness or hardness of bowel movements, nature and opinions of 
dreams, the stellar constallation at the time of his (patients) birth and at the time of 
onset of the disease, the things he hates, things he likes, his comforts and 
discomforts etc. are to be examined by interrogation; his age by both questining and 
observation. 
ROGABHEDiYA ADHYAYA 
By Anumana . (inference) the fallowing are to be examined : 
Bad taste of the body is to be inf erred from lice deserting it, the sweetness of 
the body by the swarming of flies to it; similarly his digestive capacity by his ability 
of digestion, his strenth by his sbility to work; determination of a doubtful disease 
by noting the good or bad effects of diagnostic tests, the strength of the do~as by 
• indulgence in bad regimen, decrease of duration of life by observing the.fatal sings, 
body constitution, mental standard, excellence of one or all the tissues, habituations 
(accustoms) and strength by long observation. ( 11) 
Some more verses here : 
He (the physician) who does not enter into soul of the patient (understand him 
thoroughly) in the light of his knowledge and experience, will not be able to treat 
the disease of the patient (effectively). (12)

There are two kinds of patients who do not exhibit the symptoms of the 
diseases properly; the first kind, who though afflicted with a severe disease appear 
as having a mild disease because of good stamina of his mind and body~ the second 
kind, who is the opposite of the first (who appears as having a major disease though 
actually having a mild disease due to poor stamina of his mind and body). An 
inexperienced physician gets confused in diagnosis by superficial observation of 
the symptoms of both these types of patients, prescribes food, drugs and other 
treatment which are either very mild or very powerful to them respectively and 
takes away their life thereby ( 13-15) •

By knowing a part the knowledge of the whole cannot be obtained. Hence the 
physician desirous of full knowledge should study science (scientific literature) 
constantly and understand the principles. 
The intellegent person who performs all his functions with careful 
consideration, does not stumble (err, commit mistake) even at unusual (abnormal) 
situations. (16-17)

An organic disease greatly aggravated might appear as a traumatic disease or 
a traumatic disease greatly aggravated may appear as an organic. In such conditions 
appropriate treatment should be adopted after determining their associations

Before starting the treatment of the disease, the physcian should examine 
patient, as follows : 
In which region is he born? Where has he been brought up? Where has he 
developed the disease? Which are the type of food, activities, strength, mental 
attitude, accustomed things, the likes, the prevailent diseases, the suitable and 
unsuitable things of the people living in that region? Knowing these beforehand 
will facilitate the determination of the specific causes for the increase of the do~as. 
Though the do~a may be one, there are many causes for its increase. 
BHE$AJAVACARAJY1Y.A ADHYAYA 
Carefully noting the qualities and functions of each, the physican has to 
determine the do~a involved. For example, has Vata undergone increase by 
indulgence in (bad) food orby bad activities? Whether it is due to indulgence in 
foods which are dry, quickly digestible, or cold, or by overexertion, suppression 
of the urges of the body, fear or grief? Prescribing the opposite kind of treatment 
after determining all these facts, will certinly lead to quick success. Sweet, sour and 
salt tastes have their opposites in pungent, bitter and astringent tastes respectively. 
Do~ii par"ik._~ii ( determination of the do~iis). 
Next it is to be ascertained in what manner he has indulged in the causes of 
1 disease, whether by mild, moderate or profound measure (quantity, degree). Even 
though the cause may be one only, by its different variations ( qualities, quantity) 
it produces changes in the defferent facets (parts) of the do~as, which in tum, make 
the disease to become either mild or severe. 
In diseases which have many do~as and in drugs which have many-tastes, the 
physician should carefully consider the special effects of each of the do~as and of 
each of the tastes and plan out the appropriate mode of treatment of the disease. (2)

But this need not apply (by the same) in allcases. In conditions caused by the 
~ombination of things of dissimilar qualities, in that caused by the combination of 
different things each one supporting or antagonising the other and in conditions 
which are being influenced by other factors, it is possible to relay ,on the special 
effect of the whol~ (do~a, disease or drug) than of each part of it. Thus, in such 
conditions, the treatment should,be planned, taking into consideration the effect of 
the whole.

Further, it is to be decided, in which place (part) of the body the diseas~ is 
localised. The do~as which have increased may not produce the diseases in their 
own seats but may do so in other places such as the head etc., and so may become 
difficult to treat. Hence the treatment has to be planned as is found appropritate to 
the seat of the disease (3)

Think next; to which drug and to what dose of it, are the disease and the patient 
suitable? Determination of the drug, its potency, dose etc., should be appropriate 
to the do~a, the strength of the disease and the diseased (person). Whether the 
urgent use of powerful purificatory drugs (br treatments) having the properties of 
agni (tejas bhiita) and Vata bhiita is needed or the use of the drugs possessing mild 
properties in greater doses will be necessary; treatments suchas branding with fire, 
use of alkalies and surgical instruments, are more harmfut to patients who hav_e 
poor mental stamina and physical strength. Palliative drugs ( or treatment) also if 
stronger than the strength of the disease will produce opposite diseases quickly, 
after mitigating the earlier ones, in the body which has become weak by the effect 
of the disease. Those ( drugs and treatment) which are stronger than the body will 
cause exhaustion, fainting, toxicity, delusion and decrease of strength; those which 
are more powerful than the digestive capacity will produce exhaustion _ and poor 
digestion ( 4-5)

Further, persons who are very stout, very emaciated, weak, who have their 
body parts not having well knit muscles, blood and bones; of poor digestive ability, 
take very little food, who are habituated to unhealthy unaccustomed foods; whose 
body is impoverished of essences of the tissues, will be incapable of with standing 
the desease it self. Then how can they with stand the effect of such strong drugs ( or 
treatment)? Hence, such weak patient are to betreated specially with drugs which 
do not cause discomfort, which are mild, pleasant, successively hard (increasingly 
strong) and which do not cause debility. .4' 
This should be so, especially for women because they are unsteady, tender and 
of weak heart (mind), tend~r in body and dependent on others (men) : it should be 
still more so especially for children. 
Likewise, drugs ( or treatment) which are very mild and of very little quantity 
( do~a) will not do any good for severe diseases and for strong persons; on the other 
hand, they will only aggravate the disease by exciting the do~as. (6) .

Chapter 23 
Though a drug is found suitable, still it should be examined to determine its 
taste, potency, taste after its digestion, qualities, nature of the substance (mass), 
actions, special effects, place of growth, season of collection, method of preservation, 
correct mode of using, prohibited mode of use, methods of processing, combinations 
( or admixtures), procedure of use, do~age, the type of patient for whom it is meant, 
the time (season) of use, the do~a which it expels out or mitigates inside etc. If there 
happens to be another drug of simil£U" properties, then both are to be compared and 
the best of them should be used. 
Very subtle are the variations in different states (stages) of the do~as, drugs, 
du~ya (tissues and was~es) regions, time, strength, digestive activity, food, tastes, 
accustmos, mental make up, constitution, age etc., which, if not considered deeply, 
will lead to death of the patient. If taken up for careful consideration, these will 
create confusion even in the mind of a very intelligent physician. What to say then 
one of poor intellect? 
Hence the physician should study the scriptures, engage himself in practical 
work constantly and transform his intellect ( endeavour) for gaining mastery. 
Further on; 
There are some diseases which stand out as exceptionsto the general line of 
treatment _prescribed in the texts.· In such cases, the intelligent physician should 
himself be the judge to determine the strength or weakness of the do~as without 
seeking help from elsewhere. (7)

Kala (time) also confers suitability to the drugs. It was described earlier itself 
(chapter -4) that it (time) as of two kinds viz., first, such as k~aQ.a, lava, muhiirta 
etc., the second as the stages of the patient (or disease). Time (seasons) are of three 
characteristics, cold, hot and rainy. Between cold (sisira) and hot (g~ma) seasons 
and in between rainy (var~a) and cold (hemailta) seasons, there are two ordinary 
seasons (temporate) viz. vasailta and sarat respectively. The ordinary (temporate) 
season found in between gri~ma and var~a which, is the first commencement of rain 
is known as pravrt. 
The ideal time for administration of therapies like emesis and purgations is the 
day time of the ordinary ( temporate) seasons; where as the dayti:qie of other seasons 
are unsuitable because of the risk of inadequate or excessive bouts. Siptllarly, the 
ordinary seasons are ideal even :fur the administration of other drugs ( or treatments) 
to the body, because of mild degrees of cold, heat and rain during these seasons and 
so are easy and harmless. Opposite will be the condition in other seasons. (8)

Further, during cold season, the body being a victin of severe cold and cold 
breeze, the do~a~ become stable (immobile, stagnated, stick on inside the channels) 
and heavy (greatly increased). Purificatory drugs (or therapies) administered 
du1ing this period, though generally of hot potency, get vanquished (defeated) by 
the profound cold, become inefficient in action, give only inadequate bouts and 
make the body susceptible to many diseases of Vata origin. • 
\ 
Similarly, during rainy season also, similar is the result (the drugs become 
weak and produce only inadequate bouts) because in this season the sky is full of 
thick clouds which obstruct the hot (warm) rays of the sun reaching"the eiuth, the 
cai1h becomes full of slush by lashing rain and flowing water, the bodies of men 
Chapter23 
get water logged, lose the efficiency of digestive activity and become weak by the 
effect of season. (9)

The condition of the entire vegetation will be poor in potency because of the 
net work of roots of trees will have been submerged in water due to cont~nuous rain 
falling in torrents from the womb of the clouds, the stem and banches will have 
become full with tender leaves and buds, making the trees appear to have become 
young. Because of this tenderness and the effect of slush of the soil they will 
undergo sourness during digestion; the wacer will have become contaminated with 
the cadvers, tissues, urine and excreta of birds, animals, reptiles etc., the wind will 
be very cold due to presence of water vapour, snow and mist; the heat of the earth 
having become greatly reduced, the vegetaion not having attained maturity in their 
potency, they will only cause burning sensation during digestion in the human 
body. Because of these reasons, the drugs which are collected even at the 
commencement ( of the rainy season) will be unsuitable for health (and produce 
inadequate bouts only) due to preponderance of water and wind full of water 
vapour. (10)

During grI~ma (summer) due to the effect of withdrawal ( of moisture by the 
sun), the body ( of man) under the influence of hot and dry wind will have severe 
perspiration, and thedo~as will be very loose (fluid, moving freely) and in very little 
quantity. Purificatory drugs though not hot in potency will aquire the properties of 
heat and penetrating deep inside, cause excessive bouts ( of emesis and purgation); 
the body will suffer from complications like thirst, giddiness and exhaustion. 
l 
So, it is ideal to administer emesis and other purificatory therapies, during 
temperate seasons only, if there is no emergency disease. In case of an emergency 
disease, purificatory treatment should be done by creating conditions opposite of 
the seasons artificially and administering drugs which h~ve been made suitable 
with appropriate processing, combination, do~age, mode of use and other 
procedures. ( 11)

In the context of the conditions or stages of the patient (or the disease), time 
means the different parts, viz. a certian time whether appropriate for administration 
of medicine, or not, whether a particular time either suitable or unsuitable for a 
paricular drug etc. Drugs administered either at premature time or elapsed time wi11 
not yield the desired results. 
The times of administration of medicines are eleven in number such as; 
without food, before meals, during meals, after meals, mixed with food during its 
preparation itself, in between meals( of afternoon and night), at the commencement 
and end of the meals, often (frequently) irrespective of meals, mixed or along with 
one morsel, in between such morsels and at night,(bed time). ( 12)

be ideal for that person; those drugs which possess properties · similar to the 
properties of the land in which a person is boin should be used for those living in 
a different land (temporarily or permanently). 
The drug, which by nature, is potent, fortified further by soaking it in the fresh

Bflilhai:ia is meant to make the body stout (plump) and Lailghana for making 
it light (thin); the first is caused by the predominance of Prthvi and Ap (bhutas) and 
the second by the remaining (bhutas) (3)

Treatments such as Snehana (lubrication, oleation) Ruk~ai:ia ( causing dryness), 
Svedana (sudatiop) and Sthambhana (stopping, witholding, binding) are not 
separate from the above two, in view of the predominance of the two bhuta

thedo~as out of the body; itis of five kinds viz., niriiha(decoctionenema), vamana 
( emesis ), kayavireka (purgation to the body), sirovireka (purgation to the head i.e., 
nasal medication, inhalation of smoke etc.) andasravisruti(blood letting). 
Samanais that which neither expels the do~as out, nor excites ( causes increase, 
aggravate) the do~as which are normal but only mitigates (decrease to normal) the 
increased do~as; it is of seven kinds, viz., causing good digestion, increasing the 
appetite, creating hunger, thirst, doing exercise, exposure to sun and breeze. ( 5-6b)

Ingestion off oods which are hard to digest ( or which are more in quantity) will 
lead to production of large quantity of essence of food which is in the Arna state 
(inadequately digested). This ama (improperly processed essence) getting mixed 
with Kapha residing in the dhatiis (tissues) makes them weak and causes obesity. 
Excessive hunger, thirst sweating, difficulty in breathing, too much of sleep, 
inability to withstand exertion, lassituade; decrease of life span, strength- and 
vigour, bad smell of the body and stammering (hoarseness of voice, to be more apt) 
and increase of medas (adipose tissue, fat) -all these occur due to excess of 
nourishment. 
The channels (tissue pores, blood vessels, lymphatic ducts etc.,) become 
blocked by fat, Vata moving especially inside the alimentary tract, causes increase 
of digestive activity. Because of this, there will be great increase of hunger and 
thirst, which in turn, bum away the body just as fire and wind bum up a tree which 
has a big cavity inside it; by he presence of fat, at the (site of) origin of the channels

of sweat, increase in secretary activity (moisture) and association of Kapha -an· 
make for profound increase of sweat. 
The fat getting digested in the alimentary tract and causing obstruction in the 
channels of the rasa, hinders it from going to the other dhatus, and make for 
increase of medas dhatu (fat) only~ The remaining portion of rasa dhatu being very 
little in quantity is not enough, to nourish the rakta and other dhatiis. • 
This increase ( of fat) is similar to the increase of Vata and others, ''that which 
has undergone increase first will only undergo further increase'' (but not others 
which have not increased first)'' on this analogy there will be disparisty betwen 
. medas (fat) and other dhatus. The increased medas (fat) will _soon produce 
difficulty in breathing etc., fever, enlargement of the abdomen, rectal fistula, 
diabetes, loss of movement of the thighs, nodules, abscesses and such other 
diseases . 
. Atisthula cikistsa (treatment for obese person) : 
A person is said to be very obese when he has lack of enthusiasm (in physical 
activities) disproportional to the growth of·his body, and has movement of the 
buttocks, abdomen and breasts. Such a person should be given such foods which 
mitigate Vata, Kapha and medas (fat) such as horsegram, small barley, barley, 
jowar, syamaka (black millet) green-gram etc., ari~tas (medicinal liquors) honey­
water, mas tu (whey) and takra (butter milk) as drinks; drugs which possess the 
properties of penetrating, hot in potency, dry and scaryfying; those who wish to 
retain their body thin should also be prescribed worry, sexual intercourse, physical 
exercise, purificatory therapies ( emesis, purgations etc.) avoidance . of sleep, dry 
b~thing (without anointing oil) and massaging the body (without anointing oil or 
other faty materials). 
Powder of triphala, guduci abhaya and ghana should be taken, mixed with 
honey. 
Rasafijana, mahat paficamiila, (guggulu), silajatu along with fresh juice of·. 
agnimailtha is· also good. •

ViQailga, nagara, k~ara, fine powder of iron (ash of iron), barley and amalaka 
along with honey, cures the disorders of profound obesity. 
Madana, triphala, mus ta, saptahwa, ari~ta, vatsaka, patha, aragwadha taken in

Likewise, the decoction of vatsaka, samyaka, devadaru, the two nisas musta.

Emaciation is better than corpulence (obesity) because there is no (effective) 
treatment for the obese; neither fattening therapy nor thinning therapy are sufficient 
to control excessive fat accumulation, mitigation of agni (digestive activity) and 
Vata; while the use of sweet and unetous foods and other comforts cure emaciation 
easily, obesity will not be so easily cured by the use of opposites. 
The person whose buttocks, abdomen and neck have dired up, joints of bones 
have become prominent and the body full of (net work of) veins is to be called as 
highly emaciated. He should be given all the nourishing therapies described earlier; 
aphrodisiac drugs· like aswagandha, vidari ete., will be good to him. An emaciated 
man will become stout like a boar, by absence of worry, feeling of happiness, quick 
nourishments (foods and drugs) and sound sleep. (47-48) 
Notes : Indu the commentator expalins the above as follows -
Brrhhana therapy ( more nourishment) given to a obese person will mitigate agni 
( digestive activity) and viita but not the medas (fat); whereas Langhana therapy (lack of 
nourishment) will mitigate medas (fat) but not agni and viita. So treatment is very 
difficult. Sweet, unctousfoods and comforts are highly nourishing and so the emaciated 
person derives its benefits soon. The opposite of these i.e., pungent and dry foods and 
exertion etc, will not give quick benefits to the obese person because he is unable to 
indulge in them adequately.

In diseases, which arise from lack of nourishment the use of those (foods and 
drugs) which are effective quickly and accustomed to the person should be 
prescribed. The person who has become emaciated suddenly will improve quickly 
by quick nourishment whereas he who has become emaciated over a long time will 
improve slowly by the use of accustomed things (foods and drugs). All these are 
to be used in accordance with the strength of the body, the digestive activity and 
other factors. ( 49--50)

For the obese person, foods which are difficult to digest and which make the 
person thin should be prescribed ( as diet) and for the emaciated person the opposite 
(i.e. which are easily digestible and make the person stout). Yava (barley) and 
godhuma (wheat) may be prescribed to both, prepared in such a way that it will 
be suitable to each. (58)

The above methods of treatment will hold good even for those who, by their 
constitution are either obese or emaciated. They being constant sufferers require 
these treatments as suited to them. 
Only judicious (regulated, limited) use of both thinning and stoutening 
therapies will help the achievement of balanced growth of tissues, good digestive 
ability and building of well grown and compact body, keenness of sensory 
perceptions and strength. By these, persons will remain unaffected by the duels ( of 
cold and heat, happiness and misery etc.) 
Therapies such as grahi (water absorbent) etc., though appear to be different 
in accordance with the treatment of the do~as, are ·not really different from these 
two therapies (bpilhai:ia and lailghana); in the same way, the diseases also. 
Notes : AU therapies can be included under the two· therapies brfhha1J,a and 
lafzghana itself. So also all the different diseases can be included under these two 
therapies only-brrhha1J,a _sadhya ( curable by stoutening therapy) and lafzghana sadhya 
( curable by thinning therapy).

Sarpi (ghee-butter-fat), majja (marrow), vasa (muscle-fat) and taila (oil of

its ability to acquire the properties of processing (with addition of other drugs etc.)

since birth. ( 4-4t)

In their preceding (reverse) order they (lubricants) mitigate Pitta and in their

Oil is to be used during pravrt (first rainy season), ghee at the end of var~a

SNEHAVIDHI ADHYAYA 
substances can be used by all eligible persons during ordinary ( temporate) seasons 
when the sky is clear. (13) 
Notes: Oil being very efficient to mitigate Vata it is prescribed during pravrt (first 
rainy season) when Vata will have undergone increase, ghee being the best to mitigate 
Pitta, it is to be used during sarat season when it will have undergone increase, Vasanta 
sarat and pravrt are the ordinary (temporate) seasons during which any of the fatty 
materials can be used.

When the do~as are normal (in a healthy person), and when Vata and Kapha 
together or Kapha alone have undergone increase-these lubricating substances 
should be administered during day. When Pitta and Vata have undergone increase 
either separately or together or Pitta and Kapha together have increased, lubricating 
substances should be given at night. (14)

In case of urgency, oil can be given even during day even though it is cold 
season, so also ghee can be given at nights though it is hot season, depending upon 
the do~as; but not otherwise. Using lubricating substances at night will produce 
diseases of Vata and Kapha origin whereas using them at day leads to diseases of 
Pitta origin. ( 15-15 ,--) 
Notes: The terms cold and hot in this verse referes to the seasons or climatic effects. 
The time of administration of oleating substances _differsfrom one disease to the other 
depending upon the do~as and du~yas involved and such time will be indicated in the text 
while describing treatment of diseases which should be adhered to, but in case of 
emergency the changes as indicated above can be made.

Use of lubricating substances should be made inteiligently, either mixed with 
eatables, food or used through enema, nasal drops, anointing over the body, mouth 
gargles, anointing over the head, filling the eyes and ears etc. 
Dwividha Kalpa (two chief modes): 
It can be counted as of sixty four kinds in accordance with, that '(similar) 
number of combinations of rasas ( the six tastes) described earlier ( chapter 18) and 
are known as Vicaral).a. In this (vicaral).a) method, the lubricating materials are 
mixed with some other substances (foods etc.) and so is of very little quantity; 
because of these reasons, Acchapeya ( drinking of fatty materials alone without any 
admixture) is not called vicarai:ia. Among these two, benefits of lubrication theapy 
is best achieved quickly by it (the acchapeya). (16-18) 
Notes: Lubricating materials are administered in two ways; oil, ghee or other fats 
without any admixture or by mixing them with food or other eatables. The former medhod 
is called as Achchapana -( pure drink) and the latter as Vicara,.ia (admixture), the former 
. is better than the latter. As it is difficult to administer a pure drink of oil, ghee etc., to some 
persons, so the alternate method of Vicara1Ja has been devised, by which lubricating 
materials can be administered even without the knowldge of the person.

The quantity of lubricating material which can be digested in two, four and 
eight yamas is the low, medium(moderate) and high doses respectively. Even in 
each of these doses, the least quantity should be administered.

determined. Administration of large quantities may sometin1es ·create:doubt about

SNEHA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
Notes : Two, four and eight yiimiis are equivalent to six, twelve ·and twenty four 
hours respectively. All ancient authorities are not inclined to denote these doses of 
lubricating materials in terms of specific measures like Kar~a, Pala etc., because the 
dose has to be different from person to person depending upon his digestive capacity, 
physical strength etc. ArurJ,adatta, the celebrated commentator of A~tiiiiga, Hrdaya 
refers to the opinion of some autorities to fix two, four and six paliis as the three doses 
respectively but says that it is contrary to the opinion of the sages. The other commentators . 
are silent on this issue. Siinigadhara mentions both the views without expressing his own 
opinion and preference.

For those who are having weak digestion, children, the aged, the tender, whose 
alimentary tract is not functioning normally and remains empty, those suffering 
from fever, diarrhoea and cough, the least dose is ideal because it is easy to treat 
any complications, it gives strength slowly and does not produce any disease 
though improperly administered. (21-22)

For those who are suffering from diabetes, ulcers, pustules, leprosy and gout, 
those whose bowel movements are very soft and for those who are to be given only

of the body, can only create mild complications and will be enough to remove the 
do~as. (23-24.i)

If the fatty substances ( oils, ghee etc.) are meant for the purpose of suddhi

should be in the form of Achchapana ( drinking of fatty substances without any 
admixture), of high dose and given when the food of the previous day has been well 
digested (i.e. in the mornings); if it is meant for samana (mitigation of the disease 
or do~as only), it should be middle (moderate) dose, given when the person is 
hungry ( after the digestion of the food of the previous day when he gets the hunger 
in the noon); if it is menat for brhmhai:ia (making the body stout) it hould be given

the person gets accustomed to that material. 
Once the material becomes accustomed it does not excite the waste products 
(to be expelled out) from their places. If the dose of the material or the duration of 
its use b~comes more it causes many diseases to develop in the body. Just as water

The features of properly done or improperly done Viriik~aQa (therapy w~ch

If oleation therapy administered to a person of Pitta predominant constitution, 
stiinulates the digestive activity greatly; then the lubricating materials are digested 
very quickly. The digestive activities move upwards to the region of Ojas (the 
heart) and produces many fatal diseases associated with severe thirst. Ifhe (Patient) 
does not drink enough quantity of cold water quickly he is sure to die. He should 
also be treated with immersion in cold water and such other cold comforts. Just as 
a snake gets burnt (becomes a victim) of its own poison when it increases, so also 
the person whose digestive activity has increased due to lubrication therapy. (5052)

If the lubricating substances not undergoing digestion, produce severe thirst; 
the patient's head and face should be splashed with cold water. If this does not 
relieve the thirst, the patient should be given cold water to drink and made tovomit; 
foods which are dry should be given and then made to vomit; These methods should 
be adopted even for persons who have predominance of Kapha and Vata in their 
constitution. In case of persons who have all the do~as in equal proportion in their 
(increased state), lubricating materials should be removed out by administering hot 
water to drink and other treatment described above, appropriate to the do~as. 
Only ghee. ( without any admixture) should not be used for oleation therapy 
when Pitta has undergone increase and specially so when Pitta is associated with 
a.ma (undigested materials in the alimentary tract), because the lubricating material 
quickly circulates all over the body, causes loss of consciousness and kills the 
person. (53-55)

The patient should be administered warm, thin soup prepared from the meat 
of animals living in desert-like regions, added with fatty materials. He should also 
be made to perspire. After three days of such treatment he should be given 
p!Jrgation therapy. 
After one more day of oleation therapy and another day with foods which 
cause increase of Kapha such as tila (sesame), ma~a (blackgram), dadhi (curds), 
milk, jaggery (mollases), fish and meat-soup, the person can be given emesis

If oleation therapy is to be administered to persons who are very muscular nad 
fatty, who have profound increase of Kapha, whose digestive activity is erratic and 
who are accustomed to fatty foods, they should be given therapies which cause

dryness of the body first and next the oleation therapy followed by purificatory 
therapies. By this method the complications of oleation therapy will not manifest 
and the lubrication after dryness will be sufficient to excite the do~as and force them 
out because the lubricating materials does not get accustomed to the body. (58-59)

Children, the aged, those who are unable to avoid those things which are 
forbidden during oleation therapy, can be given any one of the following recipes, 
which do not cause any harm but are sadyasnehana (produce the effects of 
lubrication immediately, instant lubricants). 
Soup prepared by boiling large quantities of meat of animals of either desert­
like region or marshy region : soup prepared by frying the meat in oil or ghee; 
yavagu (thin gruel) prepared with grains, meat and powder of sesame containing 
its oil: half-cooked mollases, krisara (mess prepared from sesamum), kambalik:a 
( thick gruel prepared from sesamum) added with oil or ghee ); milk pudding mixed 
with ghee and taken warm; 
Chapter25 -
Fresh milk drawn directly from the udder of the cow into the vessel containing 
sugar and ghee or ghee and salt and drunk immediately. 
A drink known as Paiica pras:rta peya, prepared with four pras:rtas of fatty 
substances (ghee etc) and one pras:rta of rice. 
Payasa (milk pudding) prepared with addition of ma~a (black-gram) and many 
kinds of fatty substances (or with liberal amountof fatty substances). 
Mixture of oil, sunthirasa Guice-of green ginger) and jaggery (mollases)

Ghee processed with equal parts each of yava, kola, kulattha, water, yavak~ara, 
milk, sura and dadhi (curds) -is a good instant lubricator. 
Four fatty substances ( oil, ghee, muscle-fat and bone-marrow) processed with 
addition of juices of badara and decoction of triphala is another instant lubricating 
recipe and beneficial in diseases of the vaginal tract and reproductive tissue. ( 6068)

properties such as causing secretion from the tissue pores, unctousness, thin ness 
( capable of entering through minute pores), hot potency and vyavayi property 
(rapidly spreading to all the parts of the body first and undergoing digestion later).

D ~ma sweda ( use of steam to cause sweating) is of eight kinds viz., pii:i<;la, 
samstara, iiadi, ghanasma, kurhbhi, kupa, kuti andjeiltaka. 
Potsherds, stone or iron ball are heated redhot in fire, taken out by tongs and 
immersed into a vessel containing water or a sour liquid. The fumes that emerge 
are made to spread over the part of the body which is covered with a moist woolen 
cloth. The parts of the body which have predominance of Kapha and fat, which are 
painful, or which have tumours in them may be steamed in this manner. 
Pii:i<;las weda 
Mud, sand, dung of cow or other animals, husk of grains, bran, half cooked rice 
or meat are boiled in a sour liquid and tied in bundles; or dung of animal like cow, 
which is still moist is made into balls along'with drugs useful forupanaha, are made 
in the form of a cake or thickpaste of meat is made into bundles, (all these bundles 
are kept inside a boiling sour liquid and applied warm over a part or the whole body) 
and used to cause sweating in diseases of Va.ta origin. This method, the piilqa 
sweda, is also known as Sankara sweda. ( 5)-

Contemplating to administer Jeiltakamethodof sudation therapy, the physician 
should first select a place and construct a kutagara (concealed house). The site 
should be either in the east or north, pleasant and beautiful, having black or golden 
yellow soil, surrounded by lakes and ponds. The house should be constructed about 
seven or eight aratnI (arms length) away from the bank of the ponds·, on the either 
south or west; it should be having the entrance either to east or north and facing the 
water of the pond. It should not be more than sixteen arathnI (arms length) both in 
length and breadth; with fine plastering inside, having many windows; a circular 
bench is constructed all around inside, adjacent to the wall from door to door. In 
the the centre of the'room hollow pillar, of the length of double the height of 1nan, 
is to be constructed · from mud, round in shape, with very small holes having 
shutters. This hollow pillar is filled with wood of ether khadira or aswakan:ia and 
set fire. -When burning coal gets formed and all the smoke has gone away and the 
room becomes hot inside it shold be considered as-suitable. The patient should be 
anointed with an oil processe1 with drugs which mitigate Vata, and brought into the 
hot chamber and instructed as follows : ''You, the good man, enter the chamber for 
obtaining prosperity and health.Lie on these benches comfortably, exposing all the 
protions of your 'body td the-heat and slowly move forwards. Eve:n though ·you 
become full of sweatartd even quickly, you should not leavethe bench and try to

I reach for the door, you will run the risk of losing your life for you will not be able 
to find the door, because of your fatigue.and fainting. So.oever get out of the bench, 
till your feel that fluids inside your body are moving freely, the obstrucion to the 
flow of sweat has been removed, all the orifices of the body are open and have 
become light, cleared of any obstructions, and stiffness, loss of sensation, pain and 
heaviness have disappeard''. With these instructions he should be left alone inside 
/ 
the room, and the physician come out, closing behind him all the windows and 
doors. After some time, after the patient is brought out, he should not be spalshed 
with cold water immediately for protecting his eyes even though he is full of sweat. 
He should be allowed to take rest, get rid of the fatigue and given a bath in warm 
water. Next he should be given food suitable to him. This medhod is _known as 
Jeiltak:a Sweda. (12)

Out of these methods, Tapa and D ~ma sweda should be resorted to especially

Anagneya sweda (making the person to perspire wihout the use of fire) is 
suitable for ( disorders of) Vata obstructed by medas (fat) and Kapha; it is brought 
about by, remaining inside a airtight room, covering with a thick cloth, a heavy dose 
of alcoholic drink, exercise, keeping hungry, exposing to sun light, boxing, 
walking long distances, lifting heavy weights, anger and fear.

In conditions of increase of Vata associated with Pitta, the upanaha method or 
any one of the above methods devoid of the use of fire is suitable. (14)

Persons suffering from·diseases caused by Kapha should.be prescribed dry

If Vata is localised in. the amasaya ( stomach) and Kapha in the pakwasaya

Abnormal increase ( aggravation) of Pitta and blood, thirst, fainting, weakness 
of the voice and body, giddiness, pain in the joints, fever, appearance of black or 
red patches on the skin and vomitting will result from excess of sudation therapy. 
For these diseases stambhana (stopping of sweating, absorbing water) is the ideal 
method of treatm.ent. Such a therapy is also to be given to those suffering from 
diseases caused by poison, _and alkalies; and from diarrhoea, vomitting and 
diabetes. (20-21)

Swedana (perspiration) is brought about generally -by qualities such as 
heavyness, penetrating and hot, whereas stambhana (stopping, withholding) is 
brought about by the opposite qualities. Drugs which· are liquid, static, moving, 
unctous, dry and thin, cause sudation (wanning up) of the body; those which are 
smooth, dry ,thin, moving, liquid, bitter, astringent and sweet tastes generally cause 
sthambhana (withholding, obstructing, stopping any discharge from the body).

foods inside their alimentary tract as these are capable of causing immediate effect 
(death). 
Administration of emesis to a pregnant woD.1an will produce disorders of

constriction of the heart; medicines administered to persons who are·engrossed in 
other works do not· act; or act with difficulty • producing inadequate effect; in a 
person· who is . dry, ·emesis produces catching pain in the parts of the body by 
increasing Vata; in persons who are habituated to dry foods it causes loss of strength 
because their body will have been made weak by Vata. Emesis causes ·heav3/ •

digestion, in persons who induJge daily in lifting weights, long walking or riding, 
by the fatigue of such exertion; in persons who are injured, by exac~rbhtion ofthe 
wound. In persons who are emaciated and others of that nature, there is risk of 
debility of the body and occurence of internal injury because of their inability to 
withstand the strength of the drugs _administered. In cases of continuous vomitting 
and bleeding from upward channels, udana _ becoming very powerful produces 
death by severe haemorrhage. In persons who have upward movement inside, in 
those who have been administered decoction and oil enemas, emesis therapy will 
cause excessive upward movement of Vata; in those who have obstruction in their 
alimentary tract and in those who have been administered emesis therapy improperly 
causing poor vomittings, and consequent profound straining to vomit, the drugs 
administered will only excite the do~as accumulated in the alimentay tract leading 
to visarpa, (4eipes), stiffness of the body, loss of movement, abnormal mental 
symptoms or even death. Emesis to a patient of heart disease will cause stopping 
of its functions. To those suffering from upward movement of Vata and those 
suffering from facial paralysis an~ other ~iseases, emesis will make for increase 
in the severity of their diseases or even death. In those who are having worms in 
their alimentary tract and who have not been administered decoction enema earlier, 
or the large number of worms blocking the passage, and consequent non­
movement of the·bowels, emetic drugs cause constriction of the heart and produce 
excess vornittings. (6)

The patient after taking the medicine should bend forward slightly, keeping 
his elbows on his thighs, anticipating in mind the starting of vomitting; his upper 
parts of the body should be kept warm by repeated touch of the hand, warmed on 
fire. The onset of sweating indicates the liquification of the do~as, horripilations 
indicate movement of the do~as from the places of lodging, enlargement of 
abdomen suggests the arrival of the do~as to the alimentary tract, oppression in the 
region of the heart, (nausea) and salivation in the mouth indicate the commencement 
of the upward movement; Then several vessels to receive the vomitted materials 
should be kept ready nearby. Several attendents who are standing nearby should 
hold the flanks and forehead firmly, give mild massage in the upward direction over 
the umblical region and back and instil courage. The patient should keep open his 
\ 
lips, palate and throat, do mild exercises to intiate the bouts, not forcing the urges 
which have not yet started but helping the urges which have started, mildly by 
inducing it, by tickling the throat with either the fingers whose nails have been cut 
close, or stalks of lotus, lily or castor plant. When the vomitting has commenced, 
the patient should not bringit out either from a great height, or from very low height 
or from the sides. Bringing out from great height (patient sitting erect without even 
slight bending) produces pain in the back and the region of the heart, bringing out 
from very low height (patient bending down too much) will cause pain in the head 
and abdomen; bringing out from the sides, causes pain in the flanks, adbomen, 
region of the heart and parts above the shoulders. (14)

Bouts of vomitting should be allowed to continue either till the Kapha is 
expelled out or the medicine administered comes out or till Pitta (bile) comes out. 
If the vomitting is inadequate the bouts should be induced, often by drinking 
wann water containing the paste of pippali, amalaka, sar~apa and salt. 
If the person is incapable of tolerating more vom.itting in one day, he may be 
given the threapy with period of rest of two or three days. 
During bouts of vomitting, the patient should be served with unaccustomed, 
horrifying, ugly and foul smelling things; but during bouts of purgations he should 
be served with those of qualities opposite of these. 
Always, saii:idhava salt and honey should be mixed along with the emetic drug 
for the purpose of liquification and scraping out the Kapha respectively. 
The quantity of vom.itted material collected in the receiving vessel each time 
as well as vegas (bouts/number of vomittings) should be noted .. ( 15-16)

Then, taking note of his digestive capacity and appearance of hunger, either 
in the evening of the same day or the next day, he should take bath in comfortable 
warm water and take food prepared from old redrice boiled well, without mixing 
it with ghee, salt and pungents or mixed with very little quantities of these liquid 
in consistence, followed by drinking of warm water both in the afternoons and 
mornings. He should also adhere strictly to the following regimen of talcing liquid 
foods; 
Peya, vilepI, alqta yii~a, lqtayu~a and rasa -should be used in that order for 
both the two meals, for three days and for one meal for one day, by the persons who 
have had maximum, medium (moderate) and minimum (poor) purificatory 
therapies (emesis, purgation and enema) respectively. 
Notes: Peyii is a thin gruel, vilepz is a thick gruel, akrta yu~a is soup without addition 
of oil, salt and spices, krtayu~a is soup processed with spices, salt and oil, rasa is meat­
soup-each one, not so quickly digestible, in their successive order. So it is advised to take 
the most quickly digestible one in the beginning and then the next one in that order. Iiidu, 
the commentator explains the schedule of diet in the following manner:Each day has two time ofmeals, viz., afternoon and night. On the day of emesis or 
purgation, the patient can have only one meal in the night. Peyii (thin gruel) can be taken 
once in the night on the day of therapy and both the times on the next day making a total 
of three times in one and half days. Similarly/or vilepz, akrta yu~ii, krtayu~a and rasa -
each one for one and half days, making up eight days in total for this schedule, for the 
person who had maximum therapy; for the person who had medium (moderate) therapy, 
each item should be for two times only making up five and half days andfor the persons 
VAMANA VIRECANA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
who had minimum therapy each item, shall be for one time only making up three days. 
The regimen of liquid food is known as samsq&jana krama also. 
Just as a small spark of fire, being fed gradually with hay, dry cow dung cakes 
etc., assumes a huge shape, becomes steady and capable of burning away any thing, 
so also the digestive fire of the person who has undergone purificatory therapies, 
being gradually built up by the schedule of peya and others (items of food). (23)

Four; six and eight vegas (bouts) are desirable respectively for minimum~ 
moderate and maximum Yamana (emesis) therapy; ten, twice of it, (twenty) and 
and thrice of it (thirty) are desirable respectively for the minimum, moderate and 
maximum Verecana (purgation) therapy; in terms of quantity, it is one, two and 
four prasthas respectively of the discharged material for purgation therapy. (24) 
Some other-authorities opine that V amana ( emesis) therapy is be counted till 
Pitta is expelled out or it is to be half of Virecana (purgaion) therapy. Virecana 
(purgation) therapy should be counted till the expulsion of Kapha .. In terms of 
quantity of the materials expelled, the quantity of the first two or three bouts coming 
out with the faecal matter should be discrarded ( and only the quantity of further 
bouts measured) in case of virecana (purgation) therapy, whereas in case of vamana 
(emesis), the quantity of the fluid ingested should be discarded (form the total 
quantity of the vomitted material). (25) 
Notes : From the above, it becomes clear tharthree methods, were in vogue to 
determine the three degrees of these therapies,.Viz. ( I) by observing the expulsionofpitta 
and Kapha (2) by counting the number of bouts and (3) by measuring the expelled 
material. It was for the physician to decide, the continuance or otherwise of the therapy 
by relying on one or more of the above criterea.

Further, planning for the administration of Virecana (purgation) therapy; 
the physician should ensure that the patient has undergone emesis therapy, and 
next, the lubrication and sudation therapies also. The day previous to purgation, 
he should be given sufficient quantity of soup of animals living in desert-like 
land, added with ghee and juice of fruits which are sour; it (soup) should not be 
of the nature of increaseing the Kapha, should undergo easy digestion, should 
be warm and followed by drinking of warm water. Next day when he happily 
gets up from sleep and after attending to all the regimen described earlier 
( during the time of administration of vamana therapy)~ after the time of Kapha 
predominance has passed off, the patient being in empty stomach, he should be 
given the. dose of the purgative recipe, which has been decided as appropriate 
to the nature of his bowels (movement). Except for those having hard bowels 
(movement), purgative therapy should not be administered to any one without 
giving him emesis therapy earlier. (26)

The purgative drug given to a person who has not undergone emesis therapy 
earlier, will get obstructed by the Kapha and comes out in upward direction or stays 
in the chest itself, and so unable to produce purgation; in a person who had satis­
factory purgations (therapy) the Kapha which has been pulled downwards will 
invade the grahaQ.i ( duodenum) producing heavyness or tenesmus. These troubles 
will not occur in the person who has hard bowels (movements) because of 
predominance of Vata within. (27)

If the purgative drug is administe~d during the time of predominance of 
Kapha, the symptoms described above, along with colic, flatulence and heavyness 
of the abdomen will appear or the Kapha whic_h has decreased due to emesis 
will make the purgations to occur either in the afternoon or night. The condition 
will be the same even when it (purgative drug) is obstructed by the food, it will 
only produce vimitting. The emetic drug should be administered during the 
time of predominance of Kapha to the person who has not undergone purgative 
therapy and who is in empty stomach, this will expel the contents easily in the 
upward direction. (28)

Kostha ( alimentary tract -vis a vis -movements of the bowels) is of three 
kinds -Mrdu (soft), Kriira (hard) and madhya (medium). That which has the 
predominance of Pitta is soft, it give, purgation even with milk, sugarcane juice, 
sour buttermilk, whey, pudding sweatened with mollasses; ghee, fresh wine, warm 
water, fruits of pilu, drfilc~a, piigaphala etc. That which has the predominance of 
Vata is hard, it gives purgation with difficulty even with triphala, tilwaka, trvrt, 
fruits of nilinI and such others. That which has the predominance of Kapha or that 
which has all the do~as in equal proportion is moderate (medium). 
These three types, get lubricated satisfactorily by acchapana (fat drinking) in 
three, seven and five days respectively. (29)

In the treatment of Pitta, purgative therapy should be done by drugs of 
astringent and sweet tastes, in that ofkapha with urines or drugs possessing pungent 
taste and hot potency and in that of Vata with fatty (unctuous) materials, which are 
hot in potency and salt in taste. 
Soon after the purgative drug has been swallowed, cold water should be 
sprinkled on the face of.the patient to prevent the occurence of vomitting; he should 
be asked to gargle his mouth with warm water and inhale the sweet smell of moist, 
good, smelling mud, fruits of matuluilga, jambira sumana Uasmine) saugafidhika 
(kalhara) -etc. He should then be made to lie on a cot, placed inside a room which 
is devoid of heavy breeze, with instructions to sip little quantities of warm water 
to moisten the throat and to initiate the urges and to be in eagerness of purging. He 
should be not suppress the urges, but evacuate ~s bowels into the reciving vessels 
(bed-pans) kept on the coat. He should avoid using cold water and thus feciliU:1te 
purgations. 
Just· as in emesis therapy, perspiration, salivation, the medicine swallowed, 
Kapha, Pitta and Vata (gas) are seen coming out in that successive order so also 
during purgation therapy; flatus, urine, faecal matter, Pitta and Kapha come out in 
successive order and Vata (flatus) once again at the end. 
The order of sequence of elimination of the do~as in these purificatory 
therapies is due to 'their location inside the body (normally) and to the reverse 
direction ( of action) of the therapies. (30) 
Notes: lndu, the commentator explains the above statement and says that Vamana 
( emesis) brings out kaphafirst because of the nearness of its location ( chest and stomach) 
VAMANA VIRECANA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
to the mouth, next the Pitta and lastly the Vata; virecana (purgation) brings outvatafirst 
because of the nearness of its location ( the colon) next the Pitta and lastly the Kapha. Vata 
coming out once again in the end is due to absence of nourishment ...

If purgations do not occur, the patient should drink hot water to activate the 
medicine and his abdomen should fomented with hands made warm. 
For those who have powerful digestive activity, those who have more 
lubrication in their body, those in whom large quantities of do~as have accumulated 
but very little is seen coming out through purgings and in whom the purgative 
recipe given has been digested ( and so made inactive), a secon~ larger dose of 
purgative recipe should be administered, after carefully considering the remaining 
period of time of the day and the strength of the patient. If the first dose of the recipe 
has not been digested, the second dose should not be given because of the risk of 
producing excess purgations .. (31) -

they by this habit of suppression and cosequent increase of Vata will always be sick 
and unresponsive to purgation therapy. So they should be given the purificatory 
therapies only after satisfactory lubrication. (33)

The person who has completed the purgations satisfatorily should follow all 
the regimen described under emesis therapy except, the inhalation of smoke. He 
should adhere to the schedule of liquid diet prescribed under emesis therapy and 
take the normal food at the end of it. Further, some more verses. (36) 
Emetic recipe should be administered after the digestion of food taken the 
previous day and purgative recipe after the digestion of Kapha. (36-1/2) 
Notes : The ideal time for the administration of an emetic recipe is when Kapha is 
predominant, that is, about half to one hour after sunrise and after making sure that food 
of the previous day has been well digested. For the administration of the purgative recipe 
it will be after the period of predominance of Kapha has passed off, that is, after about 
two to three hours after sunrise.

On the day of taking the purificatory recipe (either emetic or purgative), 
persons who have poor digestion, who have not eliminated the wastes (urine, feces 
etc.), who are not emaciated, who have weak ( or little quantity) do~as and who have 
not developed symptoms of good degestion, should be made to fast. By this•, they 
will not be troubled from the fatigue of lubrication and sudation therapies, from 
stimulation of the drugs taken and by the residue of drugs remaining inside (if at 
all, after purificatory bouts). (37-38)

For those who have expelled very little quantities of Pitta and Kapha ( during

Chapter27 
schedule of Tarpal)a etc., (nutritious solid foods) will be ideal for them. (40)

Emesis brings out the do~as which are unripe (undigested, not processed by 
heat) whereas purgation brings out the do~as which are being processed. So, the 
physician need not wait for the do~as to undergo processing in case of emesis 
therapy. 
Notes : All the constituents of the body including the do~as, have within them a 
certain moity of agni (tejas bhuta -fire like material) which transforms that material 
every moment. As per the doctrine of agni and dhatupiika ( metabolism of tissues) 
described perviously, increase of any substance in mainly due to inability or weakness 
of the fire-like material and consequent accumulation of undigested materials. In course 
of time, and with other helpful factors, the fire-like activity will regain its strength and 
transform the materials suitably. If by any cause, it becomes very powerful it digests the 
very substance in which it resides and so leads to its decreasf or even complete loss. 
Do~iis which are in iima (unprocessed) state cause various diseases in the body and when 
they become pakwa (properly processed), the diseases disappear. Emesis therapy is 
mainly intended for increased Kapha which requires long time to undergo the heat 
processing. 
Within that long time it may produce many harmful side effects. So the physician 
should try to treat any comlications of emesis without waiting. Purgation therapy is 
mainly for increase'd Pitta, which by nature, is predominant in tejas bhuta. So processing 
by heat is very quick and very less and even if present, the time required for their 
processing will be very short. So the physician can wait for some time during which 
complications will not develop and even if develop they can be relieved quickly because 
they will be mild.

When the upward and the downward purgaions act in their reverse (opposite) 
directions, the patient having vomittings should be sprinkled with warm water on 
VAMANA VIRECANA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
his legs and with cold water on his face and upper parts of the body. It should be 
done in the opposite manner (reverse on4er) in case of the opposite effect. (42) 
Notes: Emes!s is also known as upward purgation, sometimes an emetic drug will 
produce purgations and a purgative drug will produce vomiuings. In case a purgative 
drug has been given and the patient develops vomitting his legs should be kept immersed 
in warm water and cold water sprinkled over the face, neck, shoulders, chest and back. 
In case a emetic drug has been given and the patient develops purgation, his legs should 
be immersed in cold water and warm water sprinkled over the face etc. 
The person who is weak and having large quantities of do~as, develops 
purgations of its own· accord due to the do~as undergoing paka (heat processing) 
he should be treated with good foods which are having mild purgative properties. 
(43) 
Notes~· Indu clarifies this point and says that the patient should be given neither a 
purgative drug nor a bowel binding drug.

A debilitated person who has undergone purificatory therapy earlier and a 
person who has very little quantity of do~as inside but is emaciated, and he whose 
nature of ko~tha ( alimentary tract vis a vis bowel movements) is not known, should 
be given mild drugs in small doses, better still in repeated doses, otherwise it will

If in a debilitated person the do~as are found to be in motion and large in 
quantity, they should be removed out of the body, little by little often, using mild

for long, they cause many troubles to the body and might even kill the person if they 
are not expelled out. ( 45)

Such persons should be given an enema first and then administered purgative 
recipe which is fatty or after removing the faeces by the use of strong suppositories 
made from fruits. A purgative recipe which is unctuous (fatty) will be able to 
remove the do~as after the faeces is expelled out first. ( 4 7-48)

BASTIVIDHI ADHY A YA

We will now expound the chapter called as Bastividhi -procedure of enema 
therapy; thus and said A trey a and other great sages. ( 1) 
Bas ti nirukti ( definition of enema) : 
~~ !AY,~d I ~fffl'1i c{ic.1a ~err '{cfq~fq(I~ ~: II~ Ii 
Bas ti ( enema therapy) is made use of for the treatment of the (increased) 
do~as, dominated by Vata. It is called as ''bas ti'' because it is administered with 
a bas ti ( urinary bladder) or medicines used will reach the bas ti ( urinary bladder) 
first. (2) 
Notes: In ancient time the urinary bladder of ox, goat, sheep etc., was being used 
as enema can, to hold the liquid to be introduced into the rectum. Hence the first 
definition. The second one meaning that ''it reaches the bladder first'' is applicable only 
to uttarabasti or urethral enema. 
~~ ftcifqefiq, 01 i ~: vmf ttjgo11f~~IR&:.IIO:if,diAMl+.0R&:.11ii:I II~ II 
It is the best among all kinds of therapies because it provides the body with

Vata, alone is the purveyor of the do~as, the chief cause for all the activities 
of the body. Divided into five kinds it pervades the whole body. It is the controller 
of creation, sustainance and destruction of all external and internal things, and also 
the cause for production of diseases iri the three pathways. ( 4) 
Chapter28 
Notes: The five divisions of Vata are pratJ,a, udana, samiina, vyana and apana. 
External things means mud, stone, trees, animals, water, rivers etc. Internal things are 
the do~as, dhatus, malas, ltJ,driyas, Manas etc., of human body. The three pathways of 
diseases are the internal ( or alimentary tract). the external ( or all the tissues) and the 
middle ( or bony joints and vital organs).

Because of its easy administration it is useful for children, the aged, the 
emaciated, the obese; to those whose tissues have been depleted, whose sense 
organs are weak; for women, who by predominance of Vata are either sterile, or 
deliver the child with difficulty. • It improves, digestion strength, colour 
( complextion), intelligence, voice, span of life and happiness, it maintains youth 
and is also beneficial in diseases like lameness, stiffness of the legs, fractures, 
contractures, distension of abdomen with gas, colic, loss of appetite, upward 
movement ofvata, cutting pain in the rectum and such others. (5)

Enema therapy is of three kinds -Asthapana ( decocton of drugs being used), 
Anuvasana ( oil or other fatty materials being used) and Uttara basti ( enema into the 
urinary bladder or into the uterus). (6) 
Asthapana basti ( decoction enema) : 
The material for Asthapana basti (the decoction enema) is prepared from the 
combination of different drugs appropriate to the do~as, du~yas etc., involved. 
The different kinds of Asthapana basti (decoction of enema) are: Utklesana 
BASTIVIDHI ADHYAYA 
(exciting), Sarhsodhana (purificatory), Sarhsamana (mitigating), Lek.hana 
(scarifying), Bpilhat;t~ (Stoutening, nourishing, Vajikarai:ia (aphrodisiac), 
Piccaabasti ( enema liquid containing slimy materials), Madhutailika ( enema with 
honey and oil), etc. The other synonyms of madhutailik:a basti are yapana (which 
can be continued for long perio~ of time), Yuktaratha (which can be given even 
while travelling), do~ahara (which mitigates or expels the do~as which have been 
increased) and singdha bas ti ( which contains fatty materials to lubricate the interior 
of the body); their nomenclature itself suggests their characteristics. (6)

It is named 'Asthapana' because it with holds the ( advancing of the) age or the 
do~as, it is also called as 'Nirfiha' because it ascends up the body, eliminates the 
-do~as and also because it is impossible to guess its special effects as it is very 
powerful. (7) 
Anuviisana basti ( enema with fatty materials, lubricating enema) :

Anuvasana is another kind of enema in which any one of the four fatty 
materials mentioned in the chapter on oleation therapy, is used processed with 
appropriate drugs and is intended for producing lubrication. Its other kind is Matra 
basti; its dose is equivalent to the minimum dose of fatty 1naterial prescribed for 
drinking (acchapana the first method of oleation therapy). (8)

It can be resorted to always just as Madhutailika basti. As it does not cause any 
bad effects it can be used for children, the aged, to those who daily indulge in 
Chapter 28 
walking long distances, lifting weights, physical exercises, too much of worry and 
sexual intercourse; to women, kings, lords (wealthy persons), the tender, those in 
whom the functions of Vata are weak, who have fractures of bones and who have 
poor digestive capacity; it gives them happiness, strength, complexion, easy 
elimination of wastes, and also the do~as. Even then, it should not be administered 
to those who have indigestion and those who sleep during day. 
It is called as Anuvasana because it does not cause any harm even if there is 
food inside (in the alimentary tract) or because it can be administered even after the 
day (that is even it nights). (9) 
Note : This verse has another rendering and so another meaning also as follow : 
it is calld anuviisana because it does not cause any harm even if it remains inside (for 
long time) or because it can be administered day after day (for long period).

Though Uttarabasti (urethral and uterine enema) is lubricating, just as 
anuvasana and purificatory just as niriiha, some say it is called Uttarabasti beacuse 
it is administered after niruha basti or because it is administered through another

The material of the anuvasana (lubrication enema) administered to the person 
who has no food in the stomach, quickly moves upwards, because of its mobile, far 
Chapter 28 
reaching and subtle properties. From this Vata does -not get controlled but the 
digestive activities become greatly weakened because of the enema material not 
coming out of the body. 
If it is administered when the person has taken food, the full stomach obstructs 
the Vata ( controls it), then the fatty substances ( of the lubrication enema), will be 
able to mitigate Vata, Vata if localised in the pakwasaya ( colon) enema expels 
it out after the digestion of food. 
Niriiha basti ( decoction enema) and Vata both have powerful bouts. If they 
are mixed by f oqp, they move downwards along with food or move upwards· along 
with feces or might eyen get obstructed in the alimentary tract and remain there 
( causing distention, pain etc.) along with the do~as and food and may cause death 
quickly. 
Hence Anuvasana (lubricating enema) should be given to a person who has 
taken food whereas Niriiha ( decoction enema) should not be given to him, who has 
taken food. (15-191/~.

The patient who is to be treated with Asthapana (decoction enema) should 
have undergone lubrication, sudation, emesis and purgation therapies earlier and 
gained strength by following the regimen of liquid diet. He should be the one 
eligible for administration of lubrication enema also. To such a person a anuvasana 
(lubrication enema) is to be given first. It should be given during day time in winter 
and spring seasons and during nights in others or during such time suitable to the 
do~as involved. Otherwise it will give rise to diseases mentioned under oleation

During day the lubricating materials will be able to circulate all over the body

In case of patients suffering from diseases of Vata alone, they can be 
administered lubrication enema even though they have not undergone purificatory 
therapies, in view of the emergency of such diseases. Its procedure is, more rigid 
than that of emesis therapy. 
After .the usual auspicious ceremony, the patient should be anointed with oil 
comfortably and given a bath in hot water. He should then take food less by one­
fourth quantity of the usual, liquid in nature, easily digestible, warm, added with 
suitable fat (ghee) and followed by. an appropriate after-drink. Afterwards he is 
made to walk leisurely for a short while, then void the urine and feces. He should 
then be made to lie on a cot inside a room devoid of breeze; the cot being not very 
high, not very broad, and slightly raised at its foot end. He 9hould lie on his left side 
placing his head first. Attendants who are soft and tender in their activities and 
possessing reliable character, should be available nearby, inside the room. If the 
patient eats too much of fatty foods the lubrication enema will produce toxicity, 
fainting, weakness of digestive activity, and nausea because of presence of fatty 
substance at both ends; in case of dry foods, it causes stasis of enema material, loss 
of strength or complexion; with little quantity of liquid foods and non-elimination 
BASTIVIDHI ADHYAYA 
of urine and feces, the person will develop complications caused by such obstruction; 
if the food has been partaken long earlier and the food being in the stage of 
digestion, lubrication enema at the time will produce fever. 
Because the orifices of the seats of digestive fire ( duodenum) and the folds of 
the rectum are all located on the left side, they will be facing downwards when the 
person is lying on his left side, hence the enema material can get in or get out without 
hinderance. The person shou'fJ lie straight making his f1fID as pillow for the head, 
fully extending his left leg and bend~ng his other leg over it and keeping his right 
arm extended over it. (29)

The physician should lubricate the index finger of his left hand and also the

first followed closely by the tip of the nozzle, holding the nozzle and the bag at the 
same level coinciding with vertebral column and then push the nozzle up to the 
level of its lower rim into the rectum, slowly without shaking, neither too fast nor 
too slow and with an attentive mind. The patient should be instructed to allow the 
entry of the nozzle inside. The physician should, then squeeze the bag with the 
thumb and fingers of his right hand, slowly and steadily, pushing the liquid little 
by little and retaining a little quantity inside the bag at the end of the act Otherwise 
many complications will arise; they and their management will be described in

laugh, yawn or shake his body. If he gets the urge of faeces, urine, or flatus, the 
nozzle should be removed and after attending to the urges, the remaining portion 
of enema material pushed in. After the administration, the buttocks are patted by 
the palms of the hand three or four times, next the heels; thelegs should be raised 
from the cot three times. The patient lieing straight on a pillow, his heels should 
be stroked with the fist, next the toes, soles and the calves. If there is pain in any 
part of the body it should be given mild massage in the reverse direction after 
anointing it with_oil for a period of hundered matras. By these methods the fatty

If the digestion is good, he can be given light diet in the evening. If the 
lubricating material does not come out, he should be given food the next day only 
and another lubricating enema should notbe given the next day. The maximum 
time for oil to come out is three ya.mas (nine hours). If it does not come out after 
that time, it should be awaited for one full day and night. If it does not come even 
after this period, the patient should be given purificatory therapies with rectal 
suppositories prepared from fruits or by strong enema containing rice-wish and salt 
predominantly. The complications are to be treated on the same· lines as those of 
treatment of complications of oleation therapy. If the material does not come out 
due to severe dryness inside and does not cause lassitude and other complications, 
it should be neglected. If the lubricating material only comes out quickly without 
the feces ( or do~as) another lubricating enema should be given because fatty 
material not remaining inside will be useless. 
Next, after satisfactory administration of lubrication enema, emesis, purgation, 
decoction enema or any other purificatory therapy, the patient should be given a 
warm drink prepared from sui:ithi and dhanyaka or even hot water to facilitate 
digestion of residue of fatty materials and mitigation of Vata and Kapha. (32)

Next, at each time of meals appropriate diet should be given; peya (thin gruel)

Twenty palas of drugs and fruits of madana, eight by count are prepared into 
a decoction in the prescribed method. To this decoction is added lubricating 
material (fats) one-fourth, one-sixth and one-eighth the quantity of the decoction 
for the treatment of Vata, Pitta and Kapha and also the healthy person respectively. 
A paste of drugs equal to one-eighth the total quantity or as much as required to 
make the solution, neither too thin nor too thick, is added, one pala of jaggery 
(molasses) and suitable quantity of honey and saiiidhava salt are also added. (35)

All are mixed together, churned with a churner, slightly warmed in steam and

cold, neither too mild nor too strong, neither too oily nor too dry, neither too thin 
nor very thick, neither very little in quantity nor too large, neither salt-less nor too 
much salty and not too much sour also. It will not produce burning sensation inside 
because it is warmed by steam; churning , makes a homogeneous mixture of 
decoction, oil paste etc., initiate their combined action in the proper way concurrently,

Further 
If the bag is· not held in straight position the enema material will not go inside 
in a continuous stream; if the nozzle is shaken, it may cause wound to the rectum; 
given very slowly the enema will not reach the colon and by pressing the bag 
quickly the material may go up to the throat. 
Decoction prepared with mild drugs or solution being cold will cause 
obstruction; that which is sour and containing strong drugs, will cause giddiness, 
burning sensation and delusion. If it is very unctous it causes profound lassitude; 
\ if very dry it causes increase of Vata; that which is very thin, little in quantity and 
with very little or no salt will make for inadequate bouts of evacuation. 
Large quantity of solution will produce excessive bouts, that which is very 
thick causes discomfort and delayed evacuation, too much of salt in it will cause 
burning sensation and diarrhoea. Hence the enema solution should be prepared 
properly and administered carefully. (37-39)

The quantity of lubricating material (fats) honey should be, three palas (144

the paste shall be two palas (9. 6 gms.) all the remaining drugs shall be ten palas ( 480 
gms.) in total. Honey, salt, lubricating material ( oil), paste and decoction are to be 
mixed in this order of succession only and this will be the procedure of preparing 
the solution of decoction enema. (40-42) 
Notes: First honey and saindhava salt are put into a vessel and grinded nicely with 
a pestle, oil is added next and then the decoction poured into the vessel and churned with 
a churner, adding the paste of drugs, little by little, to reach the required consistence, 
continuing the churning till a homogenous solution is formed. This is.filled into the enema 
bag and administered. Now-a-day Satapu~pa is being used for preparing the paste.

After receiving the enema, the patient should lie on his back with a pillow 
under his head and be attentive to the movement (action) of the enema material 
spreading to all the parts of the body. After getting the urge of evacuation, he should 
sit on his heels and void the material. The maximum time for the material to come 
out is cne muhiirta ( 48 minutes), if it does not come out within this time it may lead 
to death s?on. So it should be brought out by administration of laxative oils, 
alkalies, urine ( of animals) and other drugs possessing properties such as sour, 
unctous, strong and hot potency; or by rectal suppositories prepared from fruits, 
sudation therapy, creating fear etc. The complication that may arise should also be 
managed effectively. ( 43)

After the enema material comes out of its own accord easily, the second, third, 
fourth enema should be administered till the patient gets the satisfactory effects of 
the decoction enema therapy. ( 44)

Virecana nasya -(purgative errhines) Virecana (purgation of the head) is 
indicated in diseases affecting the parts of the body above the shoulders, such as, 
feeling of heavyness, swelling, mild burning sensation, itching, stiffness, obstruction

mouth, loss of appetite, hoarseness of vioce, worms, nasal -catarrh, epilepsy, loss 
of sense of smell, tumors, malignant tumors, ringworm, rashes on the skin and other 
diseases of Kapha origin. The medicinal recipe should be an oil processed with 
strong drugs possessing the property of causing purgations of the head, or may be 
a decoction, powder, fresh juice or other suitable liquids, mixed with soft paste of 
such drugs, honey, saitidhava, fermented liquids, bile or urine of animals whichever

form of powder which will be acting quick, placed even at the tip of the nostrils it

Based on the quantity of oil used (to be specified later) the therapy is of two 
kinds viz., Mars a and Pratimarsa. That which is squeezed into the nose from a wet 
bolus (paste) is known as Avapic;laka, be it virecana or samana types. Powder used 
for causing purgations is known as Pradhamana. Some other authorities say that 
the juice pressed out of bolus (paste) alone is to be called as A vapic;laka. That recipe 
which is strong and causes purgations is be specially known as Sirovirecana. Some 
others say that all purgatives are to be called as Virecana nasya because of their 
common property of bringing out the Kapha immediately. (7)

cold, dyspnoea and cough of recent onset; every on~ during an unsuitable season 
and on a day when the sky is full of thick clouds and no sunlight. , 
The do~as getting increased by the nasal drops administered to a person who 
has taken food will occupy all the upper channels and produce vomitting,

over the head, it produces pain in the head, eyes and ears, diseases of the throat, 
rhinitis, stiffness of the lower jaw and neck, facial paralysis and tremors of the head; 
in persons who desire to take bath immediately it will cause stiffness of the head, 
lassitude, loss of taste and rhinitis; in persons who are bleeding it produces 
emaciation, loss of taste and weakness of digestion; in those who are having urges 
of urine and feces it will produce severe complications of such suppression; in 
those who are injured it causes severe pain, in those who have just undergone 
emesis and other therapies it will produce dyspnoea, cough, loss of voice and 
sensory functions, heaviness of the head, itching and growth of worms (bacteria); 
in the pregnant woman there will be aversion to food, fever, fainiting, hemicrania 
and the child in her womb w_ill develop discoloured patches on the face, improper 
sense organs, insanity and epilepsy; in the woman in purpureum, it will produce

recent onset it will produce obstruction of the channels giving rise to bad rhinities, 
falling of the hairs, appearance of worms, itching and psoriasis; in those suffering 
from dyspnoea and cough there will be exacerbation of these diseases; adnrinistered 
in a unsuitable season or on a day without sun~ight, it ~ill produce (due to sudden 
cold) headace, rigors, lassitude, irritation and ulcerations of the palate, and eyes,

increase of the do~as, appropriate therepies such as oleation, sudation, application 
of medicines on the head and face and fomentation, strong avapIQa Guice of drugs 
etc., put into the nose), inhalation of smoke, mouth gargles and others should be 
done. 
The pregnant woman who has been administered non-lubricating nasal drops 
should be given a drink of milk in which var~abhii, kakolI and kapikaccii have 
been boilde, or ghee prepared in this way. 
Oil prepared with drugs which mitigate Vata should be used for Sirobsti 
( soaking the head with oil) and Kan;iapurai:ia (filling oil into the ears). Likewise the 
use of foods and drinks which are nutritive. 
Even among those ''who have just taken food and all others'' severity of the 
disease and (nature of) the diseased should be considered for planning appropriate 
therapy. (11)

The patient who is to be administered nasal therapy should be relieved of the 
I urges of the dody, his face washed both inside and outside, head anointed with oil 
and fomented mildly; the head having been cleared by inhalation of Prayogika 
dhiima (inhalation of smoke); he should not be very hungry, he should be made to 
lie on a cot comfortably, inside a room devoid of heavy breeze, with the head 
• stretched slightly upwards and his legs slightly raised; his legs and arms kept 
stretched ( at his two sides). The parts above the shoulders should be fomented often 
by wanned palms of the hands. The physician should stand behind the head of the 
patient, cover the patient's eyes with a clean cloth folded in four layers, holding it 
firmly in position and also the head of the patient with his left hand. The tpedicine 
to be used, is taken in a small crucible made of gold, silver, copper or any other such 
metal, slightly wanned by placing in hot water. The nostrils of the patient are 
widened with the index and little fingers, his head slightly raised up and the 
medicine poured into each nostril in a continuous stream, by the right hand of the 
physician, or by using a tube or a wad of cotton wool. The medicine is to be poured 
into both the nostrils, one after the other, keeping one nostril closed while pouring 
the medicine to the other. (13)

NASYAVIDHI ADHYAYA 
This therapy is to be done during the afternoon, noon and forenoon for the 
treatment of increased Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively. It should be done at nights 
in conditions such as excessive salivation, loss of tactile sensation, delerium, 
grinding of the teeth, sudden obstruction of breating (asphyxia), difficulty in 
opening of the eyelids, bad smell in mouth, ringing in the ears, thirst, facial 
paralysis, diseases of the head, dyspnoea, cough and loss of sleep. In case of healthy 
persons it should be done at midday in cold seasons; in the forenoon during sarat 
(autumn) and vasafita (spring) seasons; in the afternoons during grl~ma (summer) 
and when there is sunlight during var~a (rainy season). For· persons undergoing 
paficakarmas (five purificatory therapies) -it should be done only after the enema

catarrh, exudations from the nose and obstruction to expiration. · If the medicine is 
very hot, feeling of burning sensation, formation of ulcers, fever, bleeding through 
the nose, headache, weakness of vision, fainting and giddiness will manifest; If it 
is very cold, it will cause diseases described under inadequate nasal therapy. The 
same disease will be produced by pouring medicine into the nose when the head 
is stretched high up greatly, because the medicine will not spread to all the parts 
of the head uniformly; if the head is bent down greatly the medicine traversing a 
long route will cause fainting, lassitude, itiching, burning sensation and fevers; 
administered when the person is having constricted body parts, the medicine being 
unable to spread to all the arteries,· causes mild· increase of the do~as, pain or 
stiffness. 
When the nasal drops are being poured, if the patient faints (becomes 
unconscious) either by the power of the medicinal recipe or by being not­
accustomed to it, then cold water should be sprinkled over the face and body, 
avoiding the head. 
During the period of pouring the medicine (into the nostrils) or even later he 
should avoid anger, laughter, too.much of talk, shaking the head, sneezing and such 
other voilent activities, because of the possibilities of developing headache, 
running in the nose, cough, blindness, baldness, greying of hairs, discoloured 
patches, black moles on the body and pimples on the face. ( 15)

After pouring the medicine, the region of the ears, fore head, skin of the scalp, 
cheeks, nape of the neck, shoulders, palms and soles should be massaged 
comfortably. the patient should be instructed to suck the medicine up into the head, 
and spit it out throgh the right and left sides and not allow it to get into the stomach. 
If allowed into the stomach it will cause weakenss of the digestive activity because 
• it gets mixed with Kapha and also cause increase of the do~as. By spitting the 
medicine by any one side all the channels inside will not become properly 
lubricated. 
He should be given f ormentations again and again till all the medicine is 
brought out by repeated sucking and spitting. 
. \ 
Next, the second or third instilling of medicine may be done in the same 
manner depending upon the strength of the do~as etc. After the administration of 
virecana (purgative snuff) or avapiqa (pouring decoction, fresh juice etc. into the 
nose), lubricating nasal drops (oils) should be administered considering the 
strength of the do~as. 
After the administration of nasal medication, the patient should lie on the bed 
with face upwards and without sleeping, for a dur_ation of one hundred matras 
(syllables). Next he should be given a vairecanika dhuma (purgative smoke) or 
other suitable therapy to bring out any residue of the medicines or of the increased 
do~as, and then gargle the mouth with hot water. He should then follow all the 
regimen described under oleation therapy, and avoid drinking large quantities of 
water. 
Again on the third day, nasal medication can be administered. In diseases like 
hiccup; loss of voice, stiffness of the neck, tetanus and hemicrania due to profound 
increase of Vata, nasal medication can be done daily both in the morning and 
evening.

In this manner nasal medication can be done for five, seven or nine days or till 
the patient gets ( the benefits of) proper nasal medication therapy. (16)

When the head becomes properly oleated (lubricated) and purged there will 
be easy respiration, sneezing, good sleep and easy awakening; cleansing of the 
head, face and sense organs, and also mitigation of the diseases enumerated above. 
The complication arising from inadequate and excessive therapy should be 
treated in he same manner as treating the increase of Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Similarly 
also the other diseases mentioned previously. ( 17)

Nasal medication is not to be given to children less than seven years of age nor 
to those who are aged more than eighty years. 
Dhiima (inhalation of smoke) should not be given to those less than eighteen 
years of age, kavala (mouth gargles) to those less than five years, sodhana 
(purificatory therapies) ( emesis, purgation, enemas, etc.) • to those less than ten 
years and more than seventy of age. 
Pratimarsa nasya just like bas ti ( enema therapy) is suitable for all, from birth 
to death, it bestows the same benefits as those from Marsa, if taken daily. It does 
not need any control ( or following of any rigid regimen) nor there is the fear of 
complications as described for marsa nasya. 
Oil alone is ideal for nasal medication to be practised daily because the head 
is the chief seat of kaphs and even during health, none is better than oil to produce 
lubrication. 
• Quick action and slow action, greater benefits and lesser of benefits are found 
both in Marsa and Pratimarsa nasyas (comparatively). If there no difference 
between these two kinds, who will go in for Marsa which is troublesome and 
associated with complications? (24)

We will now expound the chapter called Dhiimapana Vidhi -procedure of 
inhalation of (medicinal) smoke, thus said Atreya and other great sages. (1)

Inhalation of smoke is indicated for the treatment of diseases such as pains of 
the head, eyes and ears, ophthalmia and heavyness of the eyes, hemicrania, . 
rhinities, cough, dyspnoea, bad taste in the mouth, excess salivation, disorder of 
voice, bad smell from the nose and mouth, hiccup, diseases of the throat, toothache, 
looseness of teeth, loss of appetite, loss of movement of the neck and lower jaw, 
worms, itching, anaemia, disorders of the skin and hairs, absence of sneezing or 
excessive sneezing, stupor, excess sleep, asphyxia, and diseases of Vata and Kapha 
origin affecting the parts of the body above the shoulders. It is also used to 
strengthen and purification of the head, scalp, sense organs and the mind. (2)

Though the smoke is derived from drugs which are cold in potency, yet with 
Chapter30 
the contact of fire, it becomes hot in potency and so is antagonistic to Pitta and rakta 
(aggravates the disorders of Pitta and rakta). 
It is of three kinds -Samana (mitigating), Bpilhai:ia (strengthening) and 
Sodhana (purificatory); and also as Kasaghna (anti-tussive), Yamana (emetic) and 
·vrai:ia Dhiipana (fumigation to ulcers). 
Samana (mitigating) has two synonyms -prayogika and madhyama. Brmhai:ia 
(strengthening) has also two synonyms -snehana and mrdu. Sodhana has also two 
-virecana and tik~i:ia. (3)

The following persons are inelligible for dhiima therapy -those who have 
undergone purgation therapy, who have been administered an enema, \'.'ho have 
kept awake at night, who are injured in the head, who have drunk honey, curds, 
milk, wine, g1uel mixed with fatty material, poison and (large quantities of) water, 
who have eaten fish as food, those suffering from anaemia, diabetes, enlargement 
of abdomen, flatulence, upward movement of Vata inside the abdomen (reverse 
peristalisis ), blindness, rohinika ( a disease of the throat), bleeding diseases, and all 
others during very hot season. Administration of smoke to the above categories of 
persons will produce giddiness, fever, headache, difficulty in sensory perception, 
dryness and ulceration of the palate, feeling as though hot fumes are coming from 
the throat, vomitting, fainting, bleeding diseases, facial paralysis and even death. 
Even;inothers also,<thesediseases willbe ptoduce4if used in excess. (4)

DHUMAPANA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
In all the diseases enumerated above, it is Pitta either alone or in combination 
with Vata and Kapha that gets increased. So keeping this in mind, use of ghee, 
decoctions, nasal medication, application of paste into the mouth, eye-salve, 
pouring medicated water over the body and others which are mixed with fatty 
materials or not mixed with them and cold (in nature and feeling) should be used. 
By this, the treatment for all the complications of inhalation of smoke are described.

Especially the smoke entering to all· the channels produces severe pain, 
flatulence, redness of the eyes, dyspnoea, cough, nasal catarrh and sourness in the 
alimentary tract. In such conditions use of ghee, milk, sugarcane juice, grapes and 
sugar; producing vomitting by similar drugs, nasal medications and mouth gargles 
with drugs of pumgent and bitter tastes should be adopted. ( 6)

Prayogika dhiima is administered at eight periods of time such as at the end 
of 1. the night 2. elimination of urine and 3. feces 4. cleaning of the teeth, 5. of 
sudation therapy 6. nasal medication 7. taking of food and 8. surgical operation. 
Mrdu dhiima has eleven such periods of administration -at the end of 1. 
sneezing 2. sexual intercourse 3. laughing 4. sitting for long periods 5. yawning 6. 
elimination of urine and 7. feces 8. washing of teeth 9. tarpana (soaking the eyes 
in oil or ghee) 10. putapaka (instilling decoction and juice into the eye) and 11. 
surgical operation. 
Tik~i:ia dhiima has five such periods; at the end of 1. nasal medication 2. afijana

(collyrium to the eyes) 3. vomitting 4. bath and 5. day sleep. 
At the above periods of time, there will be mild increase of Vata and Kapha 
(hence ideal time for inhalation of smoke). (7)

The drugs which are appropriate to the do~as or diseases are converted into 
fine paste by grinding. A smooth, hallow reed of twelve ailgulis (fingers breadth) 
in length, is soaked in water for one day and night. Next day it is taken out and one 
ak~a ( about 12 gms) of the thin paste of drugs is smeared over it for a length of nine 
ailgulis and allowed to dry. After drying one more coating of the paste is made over 
the previous coating, thus making five coatings in total; reaching the thickness of 
the thumb and of the size of barley within. It should be slightly dried in shade, then 
the reed removed and smeared with little quantity of ghee or oil. It (layers of paste 
of drugs) should then be kept inside the pipe from the upper orifice and· set fire, to 
emit thin column of smoke at its lower orifice. ( 10)

The eligible. person should be made to sit straight, with a calm mind, 
taking deep expiration and inspirations, keeping his lips and teeth open, gazing 
the tip of the nozzle which is held very close to his nostrils. He should be asked 
to inhale the smoke from one nostril at a time, keeping the other one closed. He 
should inhale from the nostrils alternatively and emit out the smoke through the 
mouth. The smoke that has been inhaled through the mouth should be emitted 
only through the mouth but not through the nose because of the risk of disorders 
of vision. ( 11)

Kasaghna ( antitussive) dhiima is administered in the following way : burning 
coal devoid of smoke is placed in an earthen saucer and fine powder or pills of the 
drugs are put on the burning coal. Another saucer with a hole in its centre is kept 
•• j. 
inverted over the first one, so as to allow the smoke only through its hole, to which 
the smoking tube is attached. The patient.is asked to take in the smoke through the 
mouth only; when his chest is filled up completely, he should let it out through the 
mouth itself. When the drugs are bun1t off, some more powder is placed on the fire. 
The inhalation should be continued till all the do~as are expelled out or till the 
patient feels lightness of the organs. (15)

the best, medium and least proportion respectively for liquids and for paste it will 
be one kola (about 6 gms). 
In Kavala, the liquid is made to move inside towards the two cheeks and throat.

appears in the nostrils and. eyes or till the disappearance of Kapha by the action of 
the drugs. In this way three, five or seven gargles should be held or till the signs 
described under 'properly done inhalation therapy' appear. 
The adequacy of gargle therapy is indicated by restoration of health; its 
inadequacy by appearance of lassitude, loss of sensation of taste, bad taste, loss of 
appetite, excess salivation and coating of dirt inside the mouth; excessive therapy 
is indicated by the appearance of dryness of the mouth, ulceration, weakness, loss 
of taste, increased rate of the heart,. weakness of voice and ringing in the ears. These 
are to be treated appropriately. ( 11)

The procedure of Sirobasti is as follows -a bast~ (leather bag or cap) having 
opening both at the top and bottom, with a diametr of twelve atigulis (fingers 
breadth) well lubricated and made soft, to be worn on the head of the patient upto 
the level of his ears, should be got ready. The patient who has undergone 
purificatory therapie~, should be given this therapy either during the evening or 
night, afterdoing lubricating and sudation procedures. He should be made to sit on 
a stool of the height of the knee made comfortable with a cushion, hand rest and 
back rests. A peice of cloth, of the width of three ailgulis (fingers breadth), 
moistened slightly is covered on both sides with a nice paste of ma~a (blackgram) 
and wound round the head touching the lower edge of the hairs. The leather cap is 
made to sit tight over·this pasted cloth, without leaving any folds, and sitting just 
above the level of the ears; paste of blackgram filled into the crevices to prevent 
the leakage of oil, tied with threads if necessary, making the cap free from leakage. 
Then the medicated oil or any other lubricating material which is appropriate to the 
disease and the do~a involved, is made comfortably warm and poured into the cap, 
slowly, to the level of one atiguli (fingers breadth) over the skin of the·scalp. (the 
patient should not shake his head, cough, sneeze, laugh or do any act which will . 
cause leaking of oil). The patient should retain, the oil till exudation appears in his 
ears, mouth and nose or till his painful symptoms subside. Especially in diseases 
of Vata origin, it should be retained for the duration of ten thousand matras, in 
diseases of Pitta and rakta origin, for eight thousand; in those of Kapha origin, for 
six thousand and during health for one thousand matras. Afterwards the oilis to be

removed and then the cap; the shoulders, neck, back, forehead etc., are massaged 
mildly and comfortably. The person should be given a bath in warm water and good 
food. He should then follow the regimen prescribed for oleation therapy. 
In this manner, the therapy can be continued for three, five or seven days. (16)

Abhyailga ( oil-massage over the head followed by bath) is to be administered 
in conditions of dryness, itching and accumulation of dirt. 
Pari~eka (pouring oil over the head) in conditions such as ulcerations, 
headache, burning sensation and wounds. 
Picu ( oil pad) in conditions of falling of hairs, cracks of the sk_in and burning

Ascyotana (eye-drops) -is the first ( chief) method of treatment in all the 
diseases of the eyes. Consisting of different recipes of various drugs, it cures 
redness, too much of lacrimati9n, irritation, pain, burning sensation, pricking, and 
tearing pains, ulcerations, swelling and itching of the eyes. Like-wise is the therapy 
of applying the paste of drugs on the lids avoiding the eyelashes, in conditions ( such 
as redness etc.) which are not clearly manifest; this is known as Biqalaka. (2)

Nights are unsuitable for this therapy and the ideal time is the day or the time 
of onset of the troublesome symptoms. The patient should be made to lie on a cot 
in room devoid of breeze, his eyes are cleaned keeping a vessel at the outer angle 
of the eye. The physician, should gently open the eyelids of the patient with the 
fingers of his left hand and instill ten, twelve and eight drops of the medicinal 
recipe, either with a spoon or squeezing it through a wad of cotton, from a height 
of about two ailgulas ( fingers breadth), over the inner angle of the eye. Care should 
be taken not to cause redness of the eye either by the drops falling or by the 
movement of the hands. The sorrounding parts should be wiped with a piece of 
cloth soon after. In cases of increase of Vata and Kapha, the sorrounding areas 
should be warmly fomented with cloth dipped in hot water; in cases of increase of 
Pitta and rakta and poisons, cold pack should be applied. 
The recipe should not be too strong in action, too hot,. t_oo cold; very large or 
very little in quantity and staying at one place without spreading all around; use of 
strong and very hot applications will cause redness, ulceration and weakness · of 
vision; very cold recipe causes cessation of tears, friction and dull constant pain; 
large quantities will produce roughness of the lids, constriction, throbbings, lids 
being kept open always, inability to withstand the breeze and appearance of friction 
inside the lids; very little quantity will not cure the diseases; that which does not 
spread around will· cause lacrimation, friction and pain.

In diseases of the eyes caused by increased Pitta, Kapha and rakta, when the 
accretions ( dirt, waste material, or the do~as) become solidified, sliminess disappears, 
itching, angry appearance, swelling, lustre and red colour vanish and signs of 
mitigation of do~as appear by the effect of Ascyotana therapy, then the application 
of afi.jana ( collyrium) should be done for curing the diseases which involve only 
the eyes. It should not be used when the do~as are in their increased state or when 
they have not been removed. Otherwise, there will be increase of redness and other 
symptoms, ulcer~tions and blindness by further increase of the do~as. (5)

useful in blindness caused by increased Vata. 
Prasadana (purificatory) is from drugs which are sweet in taste and cold in 
potency, added with fatty materials and used at the terminal stage of abhi~yanda 
(conjunctivities), in those who have defects1of vision caused by seeing rays of the

and cun:ia (powder); each preceding one stronger than the succeeding and so useful 
in diseases which are severe, moderate and mild respectively. 
If the collyrium is in the form of a bolus and strong, the quantity to be applied 
to the eyes should be that of harei:iu (seed), if it is in the form of thick liquid, the 
dose should be that of vidan.ga, if it is mild in action the dose shall be double that; 
if it is in the form of powder, the quantity shall be two rods-full, and if it is mild in

The rods (for application of collyrium) are of five kinds -those prepared from 
gold, silver, copper, and iron and the finger itself; of these the first two, are used 
for Prasadana and Snehana (kinds of collyrium), the middle one for Lekhana, the 
last two for RopaQa. In view of its softness (tenderness), the finger itself is the best 
among all, so in conditions of presence of pain in the eyes, the hand alone should 
be used. 
Those (rods) other than the hand should be ten ailgulas long and of the 
thickness of a rajama~a, very smooth, with thin body and having tips at both ends, 
resembling a bud, of the circumference of a round pea. (13)

In case of presence of pain (disease) in the eye, collyrium is to be applied to 
the painful eye (diseased eye) first and next to the other one, otherwise the 
ASCYOTANA-ANJANA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
constriction of the eye caused by the strength ~f the collyrium does not allow the 
medicines to get deep into the painful eye ( diseased eye). Likewise application of 
collyrium, during very cold and such other times will produce symptoms due to 
increase.of the do~as. (15)

Collyrium should not be applied to persons who are in emotions like anger, 
fear, suspicion and grief, who are tired; who have taken food just then, who had 
purgations, inhaled, smoke, taken alcoholic drinks, who have been given nasal 
therapies, who have kept awake at night, who are having the urges of the body, who 
are_ weeping, thirsty; who are having fever, vomitting, injuries inside the eyes, 
headache; who have taken bath over the head, and when the sun has not arisen. In 
such persons, the heat that has travelled up will get increased further more by the 
action of the collyrium and will produce tremors (convulsions), excessive 
lacrimation, pain, dirtiness of the eyes, burning sensation, redness, accumulation 
of exertions, constant pain, difficulty in opening the lids, swelling, corneal ulcer,

The method of applying the collyrium shall be as follows:- the patient should

Chapter32 
be made to sit comfortably. The physician sitting in front of him, should elevate the 
upper eye:..lid of the patient with his left thumb, apply the collyrium to the interior 
of the lower lid, just below the cornea starting from the kaninaka (inner angle of 
the eye) slowly moving towards the apailga (outer angle). The collyrum should 
neither be too little or too large, not very strong, neither very thin nor very thick, 
neither very rough nor very smooth, applied neither very fast nor very, slow, not 
sidewards, without shaking, hitting (rubbing) or covering the whole of the eye. If 
it is in the form of powder, it should be as though going in and coming out, 
otherwise, redness, lacrimation, white discoluration etc., will manifest; After the 
application of the collyrium, the patient should close his eyes and move the eye­
ball slowly to make uniform distribution. The eye lids are also to be moved slightly 
but sudden ope~ing, rubbing or washing of the eyes should not be done because of . 
_ the risk of obstruction of heat and increase of the do~as. (17)

Further; 
After the eye gets relieved of the keen actions of the collyrium, it should be 
washed with water which is suitable to the disease, do~as, season etc; holding the 
upperlid with the thumb of the left hand, the eye is to be wiped with a soft cloth 
slowly and repeatedly; the collyrium sticking on the lid of the left eye should be 
wiped with the right thumb and on that· of right eye by the kft .thumb of the 
physician, otherwise it will _give rise to many diseases. (18-20) ~ ~ ~ 41tt2'q_ l t.l~·lllf~d <fiO(~lg$.ljq~g1: ~: I~~

The person who has developed itching, heavyness and coating of the lids after 
the application of strong collyrium, should be given an inhalation of smoke and the 
application of a strong collyrium for the second time should be done. Similar are 
the symptoms and treatment of the eyes which have not been purged properly. 
Excessive purging will produce increase of temperature , constant pain, intermittent 
pain, stiffness (loss of movement), friction, lacrimation, difficulty in opening the 
lids, Jids getting hard and causing sound, headache and debility of vision. For such 
conditions, the eye is to be filled with liquids having cold potency or a counter 
collyrium applied. Adequate purgations will cause mitigation of the diseases, 
opening and closing of the eyes easily and capacity to withstand breeze and 
' sunlight. (21)

have no movements, are irregular, dropped down, dirty, covered ( with accretions, 
blood vessels, pus etc.) and which have lost their lashes; and in diseases such as 
lqchornmila, sirotpata, sirahar~a, arjuna, su~ka, timira, abhi~yanda, adhimantha, 
anyatovata, vataparyaya, suskalpasopha and others; after the disappearance of 
redness, excess of lacrimation, accumulation of dirt and pain. It should not be done 
when these complications have not disappeared, not during very cold, very hot, 
rainy and bad days ( cloudly and without sunlight) and for those who are ineligible

When one-eighth part of the day has elapsed ( that is after a lapse of three hours 
from sunrise) or during the rest of the day, the patient is made to lie on a cot 
comfortably, facing upwards, after the digestion of food, in a room devoid of 
breeze, sunlight, dust and smoke and furnished with screens of blue, yellow or other 
colours. 
A circular wall, of the height of two ailgulas (fingers breadth) is constructed 
surrounding the eye socket, with the help of paste of black-gram flour and made 
leakproof and even; The patient should be asked to close his eye. Milk, ghee or the 
supernatant fluid of ghee processed with appropriate drugs, made warm over hot 
water, should be poured into the well, over the eye till the eye lashes and hairs of 
the brow are fully immersed in the fluid. The patient should then be asked to open 
the lids slowly and the physician start counting the matras (units of time des~ribed 
in chapter 31); in diseases of the eyelids it should be one hundred; in those of the 
joints of the eye, it shall be three hundred;. in those of the sclera, five hundred; in 
those of the cornea seven hundred; in those of vision eight hundred and in 
adhimafitha one thousand. According to the do~as it shall be one thousand for Vata, 
six hundred for Pitta, five hundred for Kapha and also for the healthy. (3)

After the prescribed time, a small hole is made with a metal rod near the outer 
angle of the eye; the conents of the well should be collected into a vessel, the walls 
removed. To mitigate the increase of Kapha due to the presence of lubricating 
materials, the patient is given an inhalation of smoke, suitable (t(i) him and the 
Chapter33 
disease). Afterwards he should be asked to wash his face with warm water and take 
foods suitable to the disease. He should strictly avoid seeing sunlight, open sky, 
bright and shining objects. ( 4)

In this manner, tarpru:ia, should be done daily in diseases of Vata origin, with 
interval of one day in those of Pitta and rakta origin and in health, and in diseases 
of Kapha with interval of two days; in conditions of increase of two or three do~as 
together as appropriate to the condition of the do~as. Like this it can be done daily 
on the third day, on the fifth day or till the physician gets satisfied with the therapy. 
The symptoms of adequate, inadequate and excessive satisfaction should be 
understood by appearance of symptoms of health, and disorders (symptoms) of 
Vata and Kapha respectively. (5)

After putapaka therapy dhumapana (inhalation of smoke) should be done 
similar to tarpaQa therapy except for prasadana (variety); the earlier two ( snehana 
and lekhana putapaka) should be done with comfortably warm (liquids), whereas 
prasadana with cold Guices). 
Putapaka is administered daily, or with intervals of two and three days. The 
period of avoidance of exposure of sunlight etc., should be double as that of tarpaQa. 
The eyes should be tied keeping a pad of flowers like malatI and mallika over it. 
The procedure of preparing the juice is similar to the one described under the 
treatment of chronic diarrhoea (chapter II of cikitsasthana. para 22). (11) 
Further some more verses : 
The diseases which develop during the course of Pari~eka, Afijana, TarpaQa 
and Putapaka due to violation of their procedures should be managed with. 
appropriate treatment. ( 12)

of the use of instruments and appliances; thus said Atreya and other great 
sages. (1)

All those which produce troubles to the mind and body are known as Salya. 
Notes :-In the literal sense the term 'salya' means that which pierces, or moves 
quick into the body. It is commonly used to denote spear, lance or arrow and in the 
technical sense to denote any external (foreign) object coming into the body. Some times 
some objects which are parts of the body, -its tissues and excertions whic/i have become 
abnonnal and even the foetus which is retained unduly long due to any reason, are named 
as salyas; emotions like anger, grief.fear, lust etc., are called as salyas for the mind. All 
these are to be removedfrom the body and mind. as early as possible for the restoration 
of health. 
The different kinds of instruments which are used for the removal of various 
kinds of foreign bodies which are lodged in different parts of the body are known 
as Y ail.tras (inst1uments and appliances which have no sharp edges), they are also 
useful for the inspection of heamorrhoids, fistula-in-ano etc., for application of 
alkalies, sharp instn1ments, fire cautery etc., and also to protect the other parts of 
the body, such as those used during the administration of enemas, the horn of 
AS70 553

animals, the gourd, pottery, jambavo~!a ( a lip shaped instrument prepared from 
metal) etc. They are of many shapes and of many functions (uses) and used both 
dudng health and ill-health. Hence it is not possible to describe all of them in detail 
here, in respect of their functions (uses). (2)

Some authorities say that yaiitras are of one hundred and one in number. 
But here they are described under six kinds, such as Svastika (those which 
resemble the svastika sign (diagram) in appearance, Saiidarhsa (those which 
have teeth), Ta.la (those which have flat discs), Na.qi (those who are hollow 
tube), Salaka (those which are solid rods) and Anuyaiitras (minor, accessary or 
very small instruments). (3)

Svastika yaiitras derive their name from the resemblance of their faces with 
the faces ofkaiika (heron), sirhha (lion), grdhra (hawk), kurara bird (osprey) and 
such other wild animals and birds. They are usually made from metals and are 
eighteen aiigulas (fingers breadth) in length. They have their face in the shape of 
a lentil, held firmly with a nail at their neck, their arms bent in the shape of a 
elephant's goad and having good handle. These are useful for removing the foreign 
bodies lodged inside the bones. Those which have faces resembling the faces of 
lion, tiger, snake, crocodile etc., are useful for removing theforeign bodies which 
are visible. In others (invisible foreign bodies) those instruments which are suitable 
for the shape of the wounds and those which resemble the face of crane, crow, heron 
etc., are useful. ( 4)

The physician who has not mastered the science, who has not been made 
eligible (by serving as an apperentice with an expert), who has not gained practical 
experience by attending ( observing) surgical operations in large numbers, should 
not undertake surgical work, because the human body is full of veins, tendons and 
vital spots. Hence, he should attempt, by practising surgical activities on hides with 
hair, flowers, fruits, gourd, cucumber, leatherbag filled with water and silt, urinary 
bladder, hernial mass, (tumor, outgrowth) muscles, (of animals), stalk of lotus and 
others as are suitable for activities like extraction etc. He should also acquaint 
himself with activities such as a pot getting empty of water through pores in its sides 
and practise squeezing of a filled-in enema bag through the nozzle, application of 
alkalies and fire cautery on soft muscles; the various types of bandaging on 
artificial stuffed human figures having all the'parts. (37)

They are of two kinds·-poisonous and non-poisonous. Those which live in 
water polluted by decomposing dead bodies, urine and ex ere ta of snakes, frogs, fish 
and other animals; which are red, white or very black in colour; thin or thick, very 
active and slimy, with thick hairs in moderate quantity, and different kinds of 
coloured lines resembling the rainbow on their body are poisonous. Their bite will 
produce burning sensation, swelling, ulcers, itching, eruptions, herpes, fever, 
fainting and leucoderma. 
These condition~, are to be treated with drugs which are antipoisonous, and 
which mitigate Pitta and rakta.

The maximum length of all kinds (of leeches) is eighteen ailgulis (fingers 
breadth); of them, those which are four, five or six ailgulas should be used for men 
and others for elephants and horses. Those \Yhich are slender, of thin skin, small 
head and large lower part (hind part) are females; those of opposite features, and 
which have their mouth part shaped like half-moon are males. 
Males are to be used in conditions of profound increase of do~as and in 
diseases which are long standing; females, in the opposite conditions. 
Leeches are to be collected by holding them with a wet leather or by other 
methods and preserved in a fresh, mud pot containing good smelling slush (mud). 
JALAUKA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
They should be fed with plants like spigataka kaseruka, saliika, saivala, ffiP.lala, 
vallura (dried meat), rurtsna, pu~karbija cun:i.a (fine powder of seeds of lotus) and 
sweet, cold and clean water. The feeds and water which are stale should be removed 
once in three days, to get rid of saliva and decomposing matters and fresh ones 
added. 
The leeches are to be transferred to new pots once in five days. 
They get into the condition of coma by incomplete vomitting of impure blood 
and aso by applying them to such blood very often. This condition can be 
recognised by their lying idle without movement inside the water and by lack of 
desire for food. So they should be removed. 
The others should be kept for some time in a solution of haridra and sar~apa 
orin A vantisoma ( sour gruel prepared with rice wash) or in buttermilk, to help them 
void their excreta; next they should be put into clean water to regain their activity. 
Jalauka vidhi -procedure of application of leeches : 
The patient who is to be treated should be made to sit comfortably, the part of 
the body selected for the application ( of leech) should be made a little rough by 
rubbing it with mu'd or powder of cowdung and the leech applied to the spot. If it 
does not stick on, one or two drops of milk, ghee, butter or blood should be put on 
the spot or a small incision made ( on the body of the patient) to get a drop of blood. 
After holding ( adhering) to the spot with their mouth and raising their shoulders 
'they assume the shape of a horse's hoof. 
When they breathe like children (very fast) and drink the blood quickly, by 
n1oving ( shaking) their head rapidly then th~y should be wrappe1 with wet cloth 
and cold water sprinkled over them slowly little by little. Just as the swan drinks 
only the milk from a diluted milk, similarly the lee_ches drink only the bad blood 
first from the pool of ( vitiated) blood. When the patient experiences pricking pain 
or itching at the site of the bite, the leeches are· to be removed, to protect the pure 
blood. If they do not leave their bite by.the greed ofblood, a drop ofhoney ora pinch 
of salt should be put on their mouth. ( 4)

After they fall off they should be covered with powder of broken rice, their 
mouth smeared with oil and salt; they should be slowly massaged from their tail 
portion towards their mouth in the downward direction and made to vomit all the 
blood they have sucked. Afterwards they should be transferred to their dwelling pot 
and should not be used again within seven days.

If the blood coming out from the place of the bite is found to be bad, the wound 
of the bite should be touched with honey or molasses, squeezed slightly to let out 
some more blood. Afterwards the place is to be washed with cold water and covered 
with a cloth dipped in ghee. When the bleeding has stopped, a thin paste of drugs 
having astringent and sweet taste and cold potency, mixed with ghee should be 
applied over the place to conserve the residue of good blood. ( 5)

The adequate, inadequate and excessive condition of this therapy as well as 
the management of complications are similar to those of venesection. 
By the removal of impure blood there will be decrease in the swelling, burning 
sensation, redness and pain. The blood which is vitiated by increase of Pitta (as in 
haemorrhagic disease) should not be taken out of the body by using either a gourd 
or a sucking pot, because of contact with fire inside them but only that blood which 
JALAUKA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
is vitiated by increase of Vata and Kapha should be brought out by those methods; 
that which is vitiated by increased Kapha should not be brought out by using the 
horn as the blood will have been coagulated; but the blood vitiated by increase of 
Vata and.Pitta can be brought out by this method. 
The blood can be sucked through the horn after making incision on _the body 
and applying the wide mouth of the horn covered with a thin cloth. 
The gourd or a pot may be used for sucking the blood by keeping lighted wick 
inside them and applying their mouths to the affected portion of the body ( of course, 
after making an incision there). (6)

There are many methods of letting out blood which were described earlier.

(as partoflubrication therapy), who are undergoing any one ofthefivepurificatory 
therapies, the pregnant lady, the woman in purpureum, those suffering from 
indigestion,jaundice, impotence; the aged, those less than sixteen years and more 
than seventy years of age, who are bleeding profusely from injury; those whose 
blood is not polluted, who are very dry, or lubricated too much, who have not 
undergone sudation therapy and those suffering from convulsions, hemiplegia, 
diarrhoea, vomitting, dyspnoea, cough, enlargement of the abdomen, bleeding 
disease, haemorrhoids, anaemia and general anasarca. 
It should also be not done on the prohibited veins, on those which have not 
been raised up by suitable instruments ( such a tieing a toumi quet, tape etc), in the 
side ward (horzizontal) direction and on days which are very cold very hot, rainy, 
windy and of cloudy sky. 
In persons who have drunk fatty materials etc., (enumerated above) though 
venesection has been done properly, the flow of blood may be either very little or .

very large. In persons who have been administered oleation and sudation therapies 
adequately, the do~as having been liquified and mixing with the blood, will be 
eliminated out fully. 
This prohibition is not prescribed in diseases due to poison, contact with qad 
things (infectious and contageous diseases) and emergencies. The method ( of 
venesection) for particular diseases will be described in their contexts. (7)

The physician after making the patientperf orm all the auspicious ceremonies, 
after determining the strength of the disease and habits of the patient, should give 
him either soup of meat of animals living in arid lands or a thick gruel mixed with 
fatty materials (ghee or oil) as a drink; allow him comfortable rest for about a 
muhurta (forty eight minutes), either in the morning or in the afternoon. Then he 
should be made to perspire either by making him sit near a hearth, by allowing 
steam over him or by any other method. Afterwards he should be made to sit on a 
soft stool of the height of the knee, placing his elbows on his knees, placing the feet 
SIRAVYADHA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
together comfortably on the floor and facing the sun. At the level of the lower 
border of the hairs of the head, a tight bandage should be tied making use of moist 
cloth, leather or inner bark of the tree. The patient should then be asked to keep the 
thumbs inside his fists, cover them with cloth and clench them as hard as he can, 
accompanied with biting the teeth (rows of teeth) one over the other as hard as 
possible, inflating his mouth. Another person standing behind the patient should 
put a long piece of cloth around the neck of the patient, make knot out of that cloth 
over the nape of the patient's neck, insert the index finger of his left hand into the 
knot, twist the knot to tighten the band aruond the neck, taking care not to block 
the respirations. This will be the method to control and raise the veins which are 
facing inwards (in other words, placed deep underneath the skin) and which are 
forbidden. 
Then the physician should raise the vein by tapping on it with his middle finger 
triggered by the thumb. On finding that the vein has risen up, is pulsating and full 
for touch, he should hold the Kutharika (axe) with his left hand keeping its handle 
up, place it on the vein in its centre, tap it with his middle finger triggered by the 
thumb or press it with the middle of the thumb. At places where the vein is hidden 
or the skin is thick, the cutting of the vein by pressing with the thumb should be 
carefully done. 
The veins get filled (with blood) by coughing and voilent bouts of anger. (10) 
Note : Strangling with cloth, clenching the first, grinding the jaws, inflating the 
rrwuth, tapping on the vein are all meant to raise the pressure inside the veins, so also 
coughing and bouts of anger. Kufharika or axe which was being used to cut the vein in 
those days must have had a vertical handle than a horizontal one as we find now-a-days. 
Hence the instruction to keep its sharp edge on the vein and tap the handle or press it with 
the fingers. Care should be taken to exert as much pressure on the axe that is just enough 
to cut the upper wall of the vein only but not to cut it into two parts.

The vein near about the nose should be cut after raising the tip of the nose with 
the thumb; the vein underneath the tongue, after raising the tongue up and fixing 
its tips under the palate; those which are in the palate and root of the teeth after 
opening the mouth. The veins of the neck are to be raised from above the nipples; 
those of the abdomen and chest by expanding the chest and keeping the head erect; 
those of the flanks by raising the arms upward; those of the penis by holding it up; 
the veins of the pelvis, back and shoulder should be cut after making the patient sit 
with the back arched and head bent down; in viswacI ( arm painful and not moving) 
and grdhrasI (sciatica) at the elbow and knee; in viswacI, the patient should be made 
the sit comfortably, extend his arm and hold his fist tight, a band is to be tied four 
angulis above the site of the raised vein and then the veins of the hand cut. In case 
of grdhrasI the patient should sit keeping one leg firmly on the ground and placing 
the other leg over the knee of the first leg, then the leg is massaged in downward 
direction starting from the knee to.reach the ankle, a band is tied as aforesaid and 
then the vein in the foot cut; in other places the cutting is carried out as found 
suitable. ( 11) 
At fleshy places, the cut shall be of the size of the barley and done with the 
Vriliimukha sastra or it may be half a yava or that of a rice grain; on the bones it 
should be done with Kutharika to the size of half-a-barley; in all cases where the 
vein is not raised, is deep seated, curved, found in a network, on vital points and 
on those which are prohibited, the instrumentation should be caffied out quick. ( 12)

Even though vencsection has been done properly, the flow of blood will not 
be adequate some times, due to the patient fainting or getting afraid, poor 
instrumentation (poor controlling and raising), too tight bandaging above, taking 
large quantity off ood earlier. emaciation, cutting with a blunt instrument, patient 
having the urges of urine, faeces etc. at the time of cutting, inadequate sudation 
therapy and the orifice of the cut being covered by Kapha. 
Hence, the physician should find out the exact cause for poor flow mentioned 
above and adopt appropriate remedial measures. The place of the cut should be 
rubbed with the powder of drugs like tagara and others, mixed with oil and salt, the 
patient should be hit in the middle of his back. By these measures when the flow 
of blood increases, the place of the cut should be sprinkled with warm drops of oil 
and salt, to mitigate Kapha and Vata and to prevent clotting of blood. (15)

If during the bleeding the patient faints the band and other controls should be 
removed, cold water sprinkled over his face, the body touched with moist hands, 
fanned, air blown into his ears by mouth, consoling him with courageous words and 
thus making him regain consciousness. After he regains consciousness, the therapy 
may by continued. If he becomes unconscious again, venesection should be 
postponed to the next day or the third day. 
The maximum quantity of blood to be let out shall be one prastha (by 
measure); more allowance depends upon the strength of the patient's body and the 
season. (17) 
Notes: In the context of therapies such as emesis, purgation and bloodletting, one 
prastha is thirteen and half paliis. In terms of metric measure, one pala is about 48 ml. 
and thirteen and half paliis will be about 648 ml.

If the blood is found to be frothy, slight reddish-blue in colour, thin, viscid, not

by the all the three do~as together, the blood will be having the colour of bronze 
or is blue, turbid and of bad smell. The features of pure blood has been described 
earlier. 
After the bleeding has stopped, the site of the cut is held by the thumb, the 
bandage and others removed slowly, a cloth dipped in oil placed on the opening 
of the vein and then bandaged tight. The patient should be allowed to sleep

other animal, obtained by cutting its vein, or the blood fried in ghee should be given 
as a drink, or such blood churned well with the roots of the darbha grass should be 
administered as enema; soup of pulses or of meat mixed with ghee should be given 
alongwith food; the same vein is to be cut once again ( at a lower place) (if a second 
cutting is needed). 
In spite of all these, if the bleeding does not stop, alkalies (mixed with water) 
should be applied, to cause an ulcer; the orifice of the cut vein should be touched. 
with red hot iron rod to cause constriction of the orifice; these should not be delayed 
even for a minute. Loss of blood leads to increase of Vata which in turn, affects the 
vital organs and produces fainting, loss of consciousness, tremors of the head,

In particular if the foreign body is in the skin will produce discolouration, 
broad hard swelling all around; (if) in the muscles there will be increased swelling, 
closing of the orifice of entry of the foreign body ,jnability to withstand touch, local 
burning sensation and ulceration; (if) it is inside a muscle all the above symptoms

except swelling will be seen; (if)it is in the veins, there will be swelling of the vein 
and pain; if it is in the tendons, it will cause construction of the network, violent 
movement and severe pain. ( 4-5)

The presence of foreign bodies in the.skin and other places can be determined 
by the exudations of those places. If the foreign bodies are small or their direction 
inside is not visible, the symptoms described so far will manifest slightly (not 
prominently). (9)

Those foreign bodies which enter into persons who have a healthy body or 
those which take a downward course inside, usually remain inside the body silently 
for long time but will cause discomforts when they are disturbed by the increase 
of the do~as, movements of sexual intercourse, exercises and trauma. ( 10)

· If the foreign body is lodged in the skin its site can be determined thus -the 
skin should be annointed with oil and then fomentation done. It should then be 
massaged with powder of mud, flour of black gram, ,barley, wheat or powder of 
cowdung. The spot where the patient obstructs the movement (gaurding) or feels 
severe pain, that will be the site of the foreign body; the place where a lump of solid 
ghee melts quickly or where moist pastes applied, dry up quickly are the places of 
the foreign body. 
In case the foreign body is lodged in the muscles, the patient should be 
administered therapies like lubrication etc.-, and made thin (weak). In such an 
en1aciated (weak) person, the places where foreign bodies are lodged, will be found 
to be loose (flabby, soft) not held tight ( drooping, loose), undergoing change in 
shape, movement, causing violent movements or pain. ( 11) 
Similarly, those lodged in the alimentary tract and cavities of the bones and 
muscles. (12}

If the foreign bodies arc lodged in veins, srotas (channels), arteries, tendons 
, - . -SALYAHARA.LYA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
etc., the patient should be asked to sit on a horse chariot with broken wheels and 
taken for a fast ride on an uneven road; the place which the patient points out, as 
having the pain etc., (gaurding) will be the site of the foreign body. (13)

The lodging of the foreign body in the joints can be decided by manifestation 
of pain etc., when the part is extended, flexed, bandaged or squeezed after the place 
is ap.ointed with oil and given formentation. 
If it is in the bone, the affected part may be given lubrication and sudation 
therapies and the place determined by bandaging or squeezing it fast and consequent 
appearance of pain etc. (14)

The symptoms commonly found at the place of lodging of the foreign body 
are : gaurding and feeling of pain at the place, when the person is made to climb 
up on an elephant or a horse, or a tree, when he does fast riding, leaping, jumping, 
exercises; when he is asked to yawn, belch, cough, sneeze, spit, laugh and control 
breathing; or at the time of elimination of faeces and semen; even with slight strain 
there will be loss of sensation feeling of heaviness, friction or swelling in that 
particular place. (16)

Generally the foreign bodies are of four types: round ( cylindrical) or with two, 
three or four faces. The invisible ones are to be presumed as being round. (17) 
Salyiihara1Ja gati -routes of removal : 
flci~i&-4Mi q~dlqh~<ul til~f.41q14l gfit(1}¥-f1Sjctlq~ ll~l 11 
The modes (routes) of removal of all big sized foreign bodies are only two: 
removal in the upward direction and removal in downward direction. (18)

The foreign material which has entered the human body from below upwards 
should be removed from above and that which has entered from above downwards 
should be removed from below, that which has entered from the sides should be 
removed in a convenient and easy way even after cutting it. (19) 
Notes : In the above verses two directions of removal of foreign bodies are 
mentioned viz., Pratiloma ·ar,,d Anuloma -which literaly mean ''reverse'' and ''in the 
same route'', respectively. Indu the commentator defines pratiloma as pulling out the 
foreign body in the reverse direction of its entry (in other words pulling it backwards) 
and Anuloma as pulling out in the same direction of its entry (in other words pulling it 
forwards). In ancient days the arrow was the chief foreign body especially in' the battle 
field. If it should be removedit could be done in only one way, that is pulling it out in the 
same direction as of its entry, because the arrow head is triangular in shape. Other types 
of foreign bodies could be pulled out in the opposite direction also.

The foreign body which has a reverse direction, whose tip is not visible,-which 
is to be cut for its removal and which has a big face should not be removed. so also, 
those which have lodged in the axilla, groin, chest and in between the ribs. (20)

Similarly, those which cause death immediately after removal, which are 
SALYAHARAJYA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
lodged in the vital organs, which have not caused swelling and pain and which do 
not undergo digestion (not forming pus) should also not be removed). (21)

The foreign body accessable to the hand should be removed by the hand itself 
and if it is not possible it should be removed by the use of blunt instruments, and 
those which are not possible even by blunt instruments, should be removed by 
making use of sharp instruments and cutting the body part. The hairs on the part 
should be removed, the blood in the wound wiped clean, the wound given 
f ormentation by fire, hot ghee or honey, touched with red hot iron if necessary, and 
the wound soaked with ghee and honey and bandaged firmly. The patient should 
then be instructed to follow the regimen prescribed for surgical treatment. 
Foreign bodies which are stuck up in veins and tendons should be freed with 
the help of a metal rod and then removed out. That which is lodged in the heart 
I 
should be removed only after the patient becomes conscious by the sprinkling of 
cold water on the face and other methods. 
That which can not be pulled out in the usual route, should be pulled out by 
any other route. (22)

That which is lodged in the cavity of the bone or that which is impacted 
between two bones, should be extracted by instruments, holding the patient tight 
and pressed by the legs. If this method is found to be useless, the patient shoud be

held tight by strong persons, the foreign body held by the instrument, the handle 
of the instrument tied firmly with a rope to the rib of a bow, at one end and its other 
end to the string of the bow, which should be tied to the bridle of a good (strong) 
horse. Then the horse is whipped. The sudden upward jerk of its head will pull out 
the foreign body. (23)

If the foreign body is having ear-like protrusions, they should be cut off first, 
before removing the foreign body or it should be pulled out by inserting a tubular 
instrument of many orifices and held by a rod. 
Those which are facing down, which have no protrusions and where the mouth 
of the wound is wide, they should be removed by using a magnet. (27) 
Those which are inside the large intestines should be removed by the

If the foreign body is lodged in the throat, the patient is made to swallow the 
stalk of the louts plant which is tied to a thread. When the foreign body is found to 
be sticking to the lotus stalk, the stalk should be pulled out alongwith the thread; 
in the absence of the lotus stalk, the root ( of the lotus) may be used. 
If the foreign body stuck up in the throat is made of lac, a tubular instrument 
should be passed into the throat first, then a heated iron (rod) is introduced through 
it and the foreign body touched. When it melts and adheres to it, cold water should 
be put into mouth to harden the lac and then it should be pulled out. If the foreign 
body is not of lac but of bitumen, bees-wax etc., the same procedure holds good. 
The fish hook or any other like it made of bone, sticking in the throat should be 
removed by the use of threads or by inserting the finger wrapped with thread or 
cloth. 
Or, the patient should be made to swallow a small ball of hairs tied with a long 
thread and then drink large quantity of water. He should then be made to vomit; 
during the act of vomitting when the foreign body sticks to the ball of hair, it should

be pulled out by the thread, quickly or by the use of a soft tooth-brush. If the foreign 
body does not stick on to the ball of hair for the first time, it should be introduced 
again and the same process repeated. If the throat becomes bruised the patient 
should be given the powder of triphala mixed with honey, ghee and sugar to lick 
slowly (to smear to the throat fully). (29-30)

be held with his head down, his abdomen squeezed and the body shaken to make 
him vomit all the water. Then after, he should be placed inside a pit which is filled 
with ash upto his neck. Otherwise, the water travelling upwards will produce 
distension of the abdomen, cough, dyspnoea, rhinitis, loss of function of the sense 
organs, fever, many other disorders of Kapha origin and even death. The treatment 
of Kapha should also be done suitably. 
If the foreign body is obstructing the passage of the throat, it should be pushed 
into ( the oesaphagus) with the help of water ( drinking) or by giving blows with the 
fist on the patient's neck and shoulders. The materials obstructing, if happness to 
be (solid) Kapha or particles of food, they should be removed either by sucking air, 
or by outward coughing or inward coughing. (31)

Living insects entering into the ears will produce pain, feeling of heaviness 
and purring sound, the pain being severe when they flutter inside. In such cases, 
the ears should be filled with warm salt water, decoction of madhuka or wine till 
the insect comes out. If it dies inside, then ulcerations, putrifaction and exudations 
appear. In such conditions the treatment prescribed for kan:iasrava and pratinaha 
should be done. 
If water has accumulated in the ears, it should be removed by filling the ear 
with a little quantity of water and oil, mix~d well in the hand, or the patient should

A surgical disease usually commences with appearance of swelling; so during 
that stage of swelling itself, it should be treated with therapies such as fasting, 
topical application, fomentation, blood-letting, drinking of decoction of drugs, and 
medicated ghee and ot~er purificatory therapies appropriate to the increase of the 
do~as· individually or in combination of two or three together; otherwise the risk 
of paka (pus formation). is sure. (3)

If by these treatments the swelling does not subside, next will be vilayana 
(liquification, softening) followed by upanahana (fomentation, poultices etc). (4)

During the process of pacyamana (inter-mediary stage}, the swelling will 
become discoloured, enlarges like a bladder, accompanied with symptoms such as, 
gaurding of the place, pain, redness, burning sensation, · 1ocalised burning, loss of 
taste, thirs, fever, restlessness, tenderness and loss of sleep. A lump of solid ghee 
kept on the swelling melts, the application of paste dries up, there will be mild 
irritation as though the part is smeared with a paste of mustard, as though ants are -
crawling over, as though aqueezed by the hand, pinched with the fingers, hit by a 
rod, pricked by needles, divided by an exe, cut by a knife, stung by scorpion, burnt 
by fire or alkalies and churned with a churner. (6)

There will be no pain without the • involvement of Vata, no burning 
sensation without Pitta, no swelling without Kapha, . no redness and pus 
formation without rakta (blood); hence in a swelling all the three do~as and 
also blood are involved. (8)

will caus~ pus formation in the blood itself, hence there will not be clear 
manifestation of pus formation. But at the place of swelling, the colour of the skin 
is normal, the swelling is cold to touch, with very little pain but hard like stone. The 
psysician should not get confused, coming across such a condition which is known 
Raktapaka. ( 10) .

Earlier to the commencement of the operation all kinds of equipments such as 
blunt instruments, sharp instruments, alkalies, fire, wooden laddies, pads of co ton, 
pieces of cloth, leaves, thread, sheets of leather, honey, oil or ghee, decoction, 
p~stes and moist bolus of drugs, materials for fomentation, pots fiHed with water, 
big vessels containing cold and hot water, fan and all other things required for the 
treatment of a wound should be kept ready nearby. So also some attendants who 
are subordinate, of unwavering affection and loyal to the patient and who are 
physically strong should also be present nearby. 
On the scheduled day and at the auspicous time, the patient should be 
instructed to worship the brahmal).as giving them gifts of curds, grains, foods and 
drink, gold and gems; bow to his personal god, perform auspicious ceremonies, and 
then take food. After these, he should be auspicious ceremonies, and then take food. 
After these, he should be made to sit or lie down, facing east and restrained by the 
attendants (held tight without allowing movement of either any part or whole of the 
body); the physician sitting facing west, should put the incision withthe sharp 
instrument, in a downward direction, deep inside till the pus is seen,. carefully 
avoiding injury to vital parts, veins, tendons, joiknts and arteries. The sbarp 
instrument .should be removed out quickly. ( 16)

Even for large swellings and those which are fully ripe, an incision of two 
angulas is indicated. If more than one incision is necessary it should be done at a 
distance of two or three angulas. The physician should then insert his left index 
finger and widen the orifice; at places which have deep seated muscles, a metal 
probe may be used for widening; at places which are narrow the hollow twigs of 
karlra plant or hairs of the boar may be used (for widening). (17)

In places like the eyebrows, cheeks, forehead, eyesocket, lips, gums, neck,

After the surgical operation, the patient is comforted with cold water

rubbed together slong with honey, ghee and sesamum and spread over a peice of

a little ghee is put into a.vessel, water added and.made into a thick mass kneading 
with the fingers of the right hand. The wick-like cloth conatining the paste of drugs 
is placed first inside the wound, then the wound is covered on all sides with a thick

If the wound is found suitable for suturing, it should be well cleaned to remove 
pieces of bones, foreign bodies, mud, grass, hairs, clotted blood etc., the severed, 
hanging and loose muscles, joints; bones etc., should be placed at their proper 
places, the blood stopped, then the edges of the wound are to be sutured together 
with the help of needles, using the tendon, thread, hair etc., as the suturing material; 
the threads of sai:ia (jute) a~mafitaka, murva or atasi can also be used. (3 7)

In brief, the kinds of sutures are four viz -Go~pha~ika, Tunnasivana, Vellitaka 
and Rajjugraiithi; their nature is implied in their names and are to be employed as 
found appropriate to the nature of the wound (or weapon causing the sormd); the 
needle placings (places of puncture) should not be very close, very far, holding the 
tissues very loose or holding them very tight. 
Having sutured the wound properly, it is to be given a coating of paste of 
afijana, madhuka, nimba, lodhra, priyangu, sallakiphala, ash of hemp -all nively 
powdered and mixed with honey and ghee; then the wound should be bandaged in 
the usual manner. (38) 
Notes : liidu the comrnentator expalins the four ·types of sutures as follows, 
Go~pha~ia -stitches to be made at all the four conzersofthe wound; (slinglike suture), 
Tunnasivana -two edges which are very close are drawn together and sewn just 'like 
stitching the cloth. ( continuous suture) Velli.tala- holding the edges ofthewouml tegether 
inverted and stitching in a circular manner; (winding suture) Rajju granthi -is like a knot 
of a rope, puncturing only once. ( Kantted suture)

In wounds cused by Vata and Kapha if located on soft (flabby) parts, bandaging 
shall be even (moderately tight) if on other even parts it shll be tight if onhcJid parts, 
it shall be very tight, during cold and spring seasons, it (bandaging) shall be once 
in three days. 
In wounds caused by Pitta and rakta if located on hard parts bandaging shall 
be moderately tight, if located on even parts bandaging shall be loose, if situated, 
on soft (flabby) parts, if bandaging is needed, during sarat (autumn) and gri~ma 
(summer) it should done both in the morning and evening. 
Wounds, if not bandaged develop the features of bad ulcer by the bites of 
musqiiitoes ect., contanct with grass, sticks, sand (mud), cold breeze, sunlight etc., 
and gives rise to many combications (secondary diseases); medicated fats applied 
to them do not remain there for long, drugs (in the form of pastes) dry up soon, the 
wound heals with difficulty and even after healing discolouration persists. (46) 
And further :

CiiTQita ( crushed) and matita (twisted) types of bhagna (fractures), visli~ta 
( dislocation of joints) and surgical cutting of bones, tendons, veins cut ot torn will 
heal quickly by bandaging. ( 4 7)

A wound which does not cause pain while getting up, lieing down and other 
postures, and having raised edges is known as Utsanna (going to heal); a wound 
which is uneven (irregular), hard, and very painful is known as Vi~ama (bad, not 
healing) and a wound which is soft and painless is known as Sama (healing) vrana 
which is clean and also heals quickly. (48)

Wounds which are hard ( or static), which have very little of muscles in them 
which are not healing due to dryness ( absence of moisture) should be scraped with 
rough leaves and then filled in with drugs appropriate to the do~as and the season. 
Such leaves should neither be old nor too young, not have any holes, not rough, 
belonging to trees like bhurja, arjuna, kadamba and such other which have a milky 
sap; the leaves should be washed well and used. ( 49-50)

those caused by the poison of karQ.ika of rat bite; alkalies, those which have poison

those which cause mutilation of the body, those having pain, burning sensation,

Flies deposit worms (bacteria) in the wounds which have not been protected. 
They (bacteria) begin to eat the itssues and produces pain, swelling and haemorrhage. 
For such a condition, the decoction of drugs of surasadigai:ia (vide chapter. 16) 
should be used for washing and filling the wound. A paste prepared with the bark 
of saptapan:ia, karafija, arka, nimba, rajadana, along with cow's urine should be 
applied into the wound. It is ideal to sprinkle with solution of alkalies. If they are 
(bacteria) still present, they should be removed out qurckly by scrapping the 
muscles. (53-55)

drugs only, is the repository of all the tastes, with predominance of pungent and salt, 
possesses properties such as penetrating and hot potency, and does functions such 
as burning, digesting, tearing, dissolving (liquifying), cleansing, healing; destroys 
worms (bacteria), undigested materials, fat and poisons; best among allmajor and 
minor (accessory) sharp instruments, serves the purposes of cutting, dividing, 
puncturing, scratching and other activities, fit to be used-in places where sharp 
instruments can be used with difficulty such as nasal polypi, malignant tumors etc., 
where treatment with sharp instruments does not succeed such as bad ulcers and

External application is of three kinds -Madhya or moderate (by the use of 
alkalies of moderate strength), mrdu or mild (by the use of alkalies of mild strength 
and Tik~i,a or strong (by the use of strong alkalies). (5) 
1he method of preparing the k~ara (alkali) is as follows: 
During the sarat rtu (autumn), on an auspicious day, the physician having 
purified himself, abstaining from food and wearing white cloths, should go to a 
big kalamu~kaka tree of middle age, and not damaged, worship it by offering 
wine, meat, flowers, coloured grains etc. ar all its four quarters, going round it 
in reverance and pray to the gods (spirits) of·the tree and others in these words 
''Oh gods, who are residing in this tree, accept my salutations and the offerings,' 
please depart from this tree without anger, this abode of yours. I am taking this 
tree, the supporter of aU living beings for the purpose of preparing medicine 
but not with either greed, or anger; Specially for the use of Brahmana'' ( and 
then return home). (6-7)

( either in the sky or on his way) should go to the tree, when the sun has risen above

which have spread either to the east or north. Likewise the branches ofparibhadra,

saptachada naktamala tilwaka kadali vibhitaka, aswamaraka piitika citraka arka 
kak:ajafigha apamarga and agnimafitha; the plant of yava (barley) along with its 
thorny plumage, the roots, fruit, leaves and branches, the four kinds of kosatakI all 
collected during vasailta (spring) should be cut into small bits, slightly dried and 
made into heaps separately on slabs of stone, at a place devoid of heavy breeze. 
Likewise another heap of crystals of lime stone should also be made near the heap 
of logs of mu~kaka. All the heaps are set on fire by using the dired plants of 
sesamum. After every heap has been consumed by fire, the ashes are collect~d 
separately after they are cooled. Then a mixture of all the ashes is made with the 
ashes of mu~kaka being more in quantity and dissolved in one thousand palas 
(48000 ml) -of water; another one thousand palas of cow's urine is also added, 
mixture stirred well and filtered through a thick cloth, several _times till a clear, red, 
strong smelling, slimy, thick liquid is obtained. The ashes remaining over the cloth 
is thrown away. keeping only the precipitate in the vessel. It is then kept on an oven 
and cooked in the process of preparing medicated oil. When ~ooking is in progress 
the nicely macerated powder of lime stones (well burnt), Ksirabaka (clay) and 
sankhanabhi (conch shell) all made red hot in an iron·pan are mixed with the ash 
in the_proportio~ of one kuqava (192 gms). All these should be cook~d, stirred 
continuous! y with laddie till it becomes a thick liquid. It is then removed from fire, 
filled into an iron pot and kept hidden in a heap of barley. This is the method of 
preparing a Madhyama K~ara (alkalie of medium strength). (8)

For preparing the alkalie of mild strength (mrdu) the ash of lime etc., should 
be put in rough powder form only but not nicely macerated. 
For preparing the alkali of strong potency (fik~l).a), the ashes of dailti, citraka 
lailgalI, piitika pravala (tender sprouts of piitika) talapatra biqa lavana, swarajika 
k~ara, kanaka ksiri, hingu, vaca, ativi~a, all are powdered nicely, ashes of conch 
shell and cowrie shell added to the solution while boiling. This should be used for 
a period of more than seven days depending upon the strength of the disease for 
which it is meant. If it is found to have become weak, it should again be dissolved 
in alkaline solution. 
K~iira guJJ,iih -good qualities of alkalies: 
The ten ideal qualities of caustic alkalies are -neither too strong nor too weak, 
white in colour, soft, quick in action, slimy, form a small peak (heap) if made to 
fall from a little height, easily dissolving, causing little p~in and no exudations. 
K~iira do~iih -bad qualities of alkalies : 
The ten bad qualities are -very hot or very cold (in potency), very strong or 
very mild, very thin or very thick, very slimy, not spreading around, prepared with 
few drugs and cooked inadequately. (9)

Before commencing the caustic therapy the following materials should be 
kept ready at hand -cloth, wick, metal rods, laddies, afijalika (a young mouse), 
ghee, honey, sukta (sour gruel), tu~odaka (sour liquid prepared from husks), mastu 
(whey), water, milk, cold pastes, cots and other furnitures etc. 
Then the patient eligible to receive caustic therapy should be made to sit or lie 
( on a cot) and held tight by loyal attendants. The diseased part ( on which he alkali 
is to be applied) should be punctured, scratched or cut by a knife, and the alkali 
applied to the spot with a metal rod whose tip is wrapped with piece of cloth, pad 
of wool or any other covering. After the application, a period of one hundred matras 
( time required to pronounce a vowel is one matra and hundred matras will be about 
20 seconds). 
In diseases of the eyelids, they should be held everted, the cornea should be 
covered with either a piece of cloth or with bees wax and the alkali applied in thin 
layer as thin as a lotus petal. 
In nasal polyps, malignant tumors, the patient is made to sit facing the sun, the 
nostrils everted and alkali applied and allowed for a duration of fifty matras. 
Similar is the procedure in polyps of the ears .

' In haemorrhoids, the rectal orifice and surrounding parts should be covered 
with the rectal speculam held in the hand, alkali applied on the pile mass and 
allowed for a duration of one hundred matras. 
After the stipulated time, the alkali is removed by a brush, the site inspected 
for signs of proper burning and then smeared with ghee and honey or sour liquid 
prepared from grains, or husks; whey, milk etc. After some time the area should 
be covered with a paste of drugs which are cold in potency and sweet (in taste) 
mixed with ghee. He should be given foods and other therapies which promote 
secretions and moistening of the body. 
If the pile mass does 'not shrink or fall off due to being deep seated then it 
should be given a covering with the paste made from the precipitate of rice-gruel, 
powder of madhuya~thl mixed with sesame oil, or with the milky sap of suvatl)aksirl 
or powder of trvrt mixed with decoction of vidailga. The wound is then to be 
I 
washed with decoction of malati, vr~a, ailkola, nirhba, asphota, patola and leaves 
of karavira. The medicated oil prepared with the paste or decoction above drugs, 
should be applied for healing of the wound or oil prepared with nagapu~pa, 
mafiji~!a, candana and tila part).ika. The wound is to be treated depending upon the 
disease and the do~as involved. Tila and ya~timadhuka together are ideal for the 
healing of wound. (10)

of Jambu, slightly depressed in the centre, the symptoms of itse]f.(bum by caustic 
alkali) and of the original disease subsiding -ate the features of Samyak dagdha 
(bums caused by properly applied caustic alkali); symptoms opposite to the above, 
developing pricking pain, itching, and lassitude are the features of Durdagdha 
(inadequate therapy). In such a case the alkali should be applied again. 
Appearance of local burning sensation, redness and swelling, fever, ulceration, 
erysepelas, diseases of the head due to increase of Vata and_pitta are the features of 
Atidagdha ( excess therapy). 
Further, in case of eyelids, disruption of sensory function of the eye due to 
puncture in the lids; in case of the nos~, destruction of the nasal cartilage, 
constriction of the passage and loss of sense of smell; likewise in the ears; in case 
of the rectum, obstruction of urine and faeces, diarrhoea, loss of sexual vigour 
(impotence) , fissures in the rectum, or death; or presence of swelling, pricking pain 
and exudation continuously always, loss of capacity to withhold the urges of 
faeces, urine and flatus-are all produced by excessive alkali therapy. These, 
conditions 'are. to be treated quickly by repeated washing and application of 
soothing oils etc. as described earlier. Another application of alkali should not be 
done soon even if necessary. ( 11) 
Some verses more:

The effects of the caustic alkalies become mitigated (nullified) by contact with 
cold and sour substances because it (alkali) becomes sweet. So the place on which 
alkali has been applied should be smeared with sour substances. ( 12)

Excess of alkali therapy will produce fever, diarrhoea, thirst, delusion; 
fainting, pain in the heart and elsewhere and bums the bodyjustlike fire in the 
hearth. Hence such a patient should be given ghee; curds, whey mixed with 
mollasses or oil mixed with sugar or juice of fruits of dhatri, kapittha with ghee; 
the juice with twice its quantity of ghee is ideal as a drink and· as on external 
application to relive the pain of excess alkali therapy. 
The juice of fruits of dacµma, amalaka, amrata, kapittha, karamardaka, amra 
and matuluilga should be cooked on nilldfire and given as a drink to those who had 
excess alkali therapy, according to their strength. By this, all the effects of the alkali 
will be removed and the skin regains its complexion. In, case of excess of bleeding, 
the patient should be given cold treatment both external and internal .

Fire cautery (branding) is more powerful than caustic alkali, successfully 
usable in diseases which are not amenable to drugs, surgical treatment and caustic 
alkalies and gives no room for the diseases to recur. It can be done to the skin, 
muscles, veins, tendons, joints and bones. 
In diseases like discoloured patches, moles and warts on the skin; painful, stiff 
and drooping body parts, ophthalmia, glaucoma, pain of the head, eyebrows, 
temples and forehead, branding should be done on the skin of the diseased part by 
using the suryakanta stone, pippali, (pellet of) excreta of a goat, tooth of a cow, 
arrow head, or metal rod; in ophthalmia, glaucoma etc., over the eye-brows, 
temples and forehead. In diseases like tumors, malignant tumors, haemorrhoids, 
rectal fistula, scrofula, filariasis, intestinal hernia, pad ulcers, sinus ulcers, deep or 

AGNIKAR.AfA VIDHI ADHYAYA 
concealed ulcers and puyalasaka ( a disease of the eye) it should be done by using 
a Jambavo~ta (an appliance made from metal, having lips like fruits of jambu), 
needles, metal rod, ghee, mollasses, honey, bees-wax, oil, muscle-fat , rods of gold, 
copper, iron, silver or bronze; this branding should bum the muscle. 
In diseases like tearing or cutting of the veins, tend?ns, joint and bones; 
profuse bleeding, sinus ulcer of the gums, in diseases ,_ of the eye such as 
slistavartma, upapak~ma and lagai:ia; liilganasa; and in cases of improper 
venesection, branding should be done by using Jarnbavo~ta, needle, metal rod, 
honey, bees-wax, mollasses (jaggery) oil or ghee, it should be on the veins 
etc .. (2)

The patient who is eligible for branding should be instructed to perform all

Chapter40 
auspicious ceremonies; ( the physician should) keep ready at hand all the equipments 
needed, (make the patient) sit or lie down with his head held tight by attendents. 
A small open hearth is to be constructed, fixed with bellows similar to that of an 
ironsmith; into the hearth, wood of khadira or badari are put in and set fire. When 
the smoke has caesed and red burning coal is ready, the physician should put 
Jambavo~ta and other instruments into the hearth, make their points (tips) red-hot: 
take them out and place them on the body of the patient, creating marks such as 
circular, semicircullar, swastika, number eight, point, straight line, dotted_patch 
and such others; the patient being kept assured by encouraging words all the tµne. 
Branding should be as much deep as required for the disease and till the symptoms 
of proper cauterisation manifest. 
In condition such as wounds which are swollen, which have cavities, which 
are cut off and hanging; in cavity of the tooth; wounds having worms (bacteria) and 
bad ulcers, branding should be done by filling them with hot fats, ( oil, ghee etc) 
bees-wax, honey and mollasses (jaggery). 
. . . . . . 
After satisfactory branding the area should be smeared with honey, ghee and 
paste of drugs which are cold and unctous. ( 4)

In case of inadequate and excess branding the symptoms will be similar to that 
an accidental burning and the_ir treatment is also similar to that condition. (5)

. Improper burning is of four kinds; Tuttha, Durdagdha, Samyakdagdha and 
Atidagdha; Tuttha is that, which causes discolouration and severe burning sensation 
locally; Durdagdha is that in which boils with severe local burning sensation 
develop (on the part) ~nd burning sensation and pain are found in other parts of the 
body, and the boils requiring a long time to heal; Samyakdagdha is that in which 
the burnt parts assume the colour of a ripe fruit of ta.la ( dark bluish-black) and other 
symptoms of properly done branding are seen; Atidgdha is that which has severe 
pain, feeling as though hot smoke is coming o~t, muscles drooping (falling) out, 
disorders of the veins etc., wound becoming deeper, fever, burning sensation al1 
over the body, thirst, fainting, profuse bleeding and its complications; the wound 
healing with difficulty and discolouration even after healing. 
Burning caused by boiling fatty materials (oil, ghee etc.) (scalds}will also be 
difficult, because of the :capacity of fats to get deep into, minute channels of the 
tissues and so the wounds caused by them will be very deep. ( 6}

The treatment ofTuthadagdha is exposure to heat and other hot therapies only, 
because the solidified ( clotted) blood, does not come out by resorting to cold 
therapies, and when it is inside there will be increase of pain; hence only after 
expelling out the heat, treatment should be done to reduce the pain. (7-8)

In conditions od Durdagdha, the treatment should be both hot and cold togther 
and then application of ghee and washing with cold decoctions ( of drugs which 
possess cold potency). (9)

In Samyakdagdha, the wound should be smeared with ghee processed with 
tavaksI:ri, plak~a, caiidana gairika and am_rta or with a paste of meat of animals 
living in marshy regions. After th~ heat subsides, the treatment prescribed for 
abscess due to increase of Pitta should be undertaken. 
In case of Atidagdha, the muscles which have been drooping should be cut off, 
given cold treatment and then the wound should be smeared with ghee macerated 
with broken rice or the decoction of the bark of tiilduka; it is next covered with 
leaves of guc;luci or that of upodika. Next, the treatment as prescribed for visarpa 
(herpes) of Pitta origin· should be done. 
In case of burning by fatty materials, (scalds) the treatment should be to 
produce profound dryness inside. ( 10-13)
